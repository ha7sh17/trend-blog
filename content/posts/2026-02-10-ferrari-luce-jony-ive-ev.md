Ferrari just dropped the automotive equivalent of a mic drop. The Italian supercar maker has unveiled the interior of its first fully electric vehicle—the **Ferrari Luce**—and it's designed by none other than Jony Ive, the legendary designer who shaped Apple's iconic products for nearly three decades.

If you've ever wondered what the cancelled Apple Car might have looked like inside, the Luce might be your closest glimpse into that alternate reality.

## What Is the Ferrari Luce EV?

The Ferrari Luce (pronounced "loo-chay," Italian for "light") represents Ferrari's bold leap into the electric vehicle market. While the automaker previously teased this project under the nickname "Elettrica," CEO Benedetto Vigna announced the official rebrand at an exclusive unveiling event in San Francisco's iconic Transamerica building last week.

"This is a project that will enlighten our future, our road ahead," Vigna declared, explaining why the name Elettrica was abandoned. "There are many other things that are at the core of Ferrari Luce. Elettrica would have been a wrong name for our car."

The message is clear: Ferrari doesn't want you thinking about batteries and charging stations. They want you thinking about the same visceral emotions that have defined their brand for decades—just powered differently.

## Inside the Jony Ive-Designed Ferrari Interior

Here's where things get seriously interesting. Ive's design firm LoveFrom spent five years crafting an interior that feels like stepping into an Apple product on wheels.

"Cars are very complicated," Ive admitted at the unveiling. "But I hope that it will be obvious and clear the amount of care that has gone into every little piece."

Care might be an understatement. The cockpit features:

- **Over 40 glass components** made from Corning Gorilla Glass—the same material protecting your iPhone
- **Brushed aluminum everything**—buttons, knobs, accent pieces
- **Samsung OLED displays** with convex lenses creating a parallax effect
- **Physical buttons with singular purposes** designed to keep your eyes on the road
- **Climate vents that open like butterfly valves** on a Top Fuel dragster

"You don't touch anything but aluminum, glass, or leather," Ferrari reps emphasized repeatedly. The only plastic? A couple of internal gears hidden from view.

## The Apple Car Connection: Why This Matters

Let's address the elephant in the room. Apple worked on Project Titan—their electric car initiative—for over a decade before killing it in 2024. Jony Ive would have contributed extensively to those interior designs before leaving Apple in 2019.

While we'll never see what Apple had planned, the Ferrari Luce offers tantalizing hints.

The design language screams Apple: squircles everywhere, obsessive symmetry, rounded corners enforced with what one observer called "ruthless efficiency." Small glass knobs evoke the Apple Watch crown. The central display could easily pass for an iPad.

Even the reveal video was edited like an iPhone launch keynote.

During his introduction, Ive made a comment that drew knowing laughs from the audience: "Part of my grumpy belligerence now is I'm done working with assholes."

Make of that what you will.

## Ferrari Luce Interior Features That Stand Out

### The Magical Key Fob

Perhaps the most delightfully Apple-like detail is the key. The fob features a yellow E Ink panel. Push it into the magnetized receiver in the center console, and watch magic happen—the yellow glow dims on the key and transfers to illuminate the glass gear shifter.

It's meant to symbolize a "transference of life" from key to car. Pure Ive.

### Tactile Control Philosophy

In an age where every car manufacturer stuffs touchscreens into dashboards, Ive went deliberately opposite. Every button has one purpose. Every knob does one thing.

"When you look at this, you are not wondering, 'How many layers deep am I going to have to go to find something to make my bottom warm?'" Ive explained.

Physical controls. Muscle memory. Eyes on the road. Revolutionary in its simplicity.

### The Floating Gauge Cluster

The binnacle behind the steering wheel looks like an iPhone in landscape mode with three Apple Watches positioned in the center. But here's the clever bit: the speedometer and odometer needles are actual physical pieces made of aluminum and polycarbonates.

When the car powers off, screens go dark and the needles appear to float in void. When powered on, OLED screens illuminate behind them. Analog meets digital in the most elegant way possible.

## Ferrari Luce Release Date and What's Next

Ferrari is rolling out the Luce reveal in three phases:

1. **October 2025** - Powertrain details (completed)
2. **February 2026** - Interior unveiling (just happened)
3. **May 2026** - Full exterior reveal

The company remains tight-lipped about pricing, but given Ferrari's typical positioning and the five years of LoveFrom design work involved, expect stratospheric numbers. This isn't meant to compete with a Model S. It's meant to redefine what an electric luxury vehicle can be.

## Why the Ferrari Luce Matters for the EV Industry

Ferrari's entrance into the EV market sends a powerful signal. If the brand synonymous with roaring V12 engines and manual transmissions is going electric—and investing this heavily in making it feel special—the automotive transition has truly reached a tipping point.

The Luce proves that electric doesn't have to mean sterile. That sustainability and soul aren't mutually exclusive.

And having Jony Ive's fingerprints all over it? That's Ferrari making a statement about where automotive design is heading. Not just touchscreens and minimalism for minimalism's sake, but thoughtful, tactile, human-centered design.

The kind of design that makes you want to touch every surface. Click every button. Actually enjoy being inside a car.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much will the Ferrari Luce cost?

Ferrari hasn't announced official pricing yet. However, given that the Purosangue SUV starts around $400,000 and considering the extensive LoveFrom design partnership, industry analysts expect the Luce to command a significant premium—potentially $500,000 or more.

### When can you buy the Ferrari Luce?

The full exterior will be revealed in May 2026, with production expected to follow. Actual delivery dates haven't been confirmed, but late 2026 or early 2027 seems likely for first customer vehicles.

### Did Jony Ive design the entire Ferrari Luce?

LoveFrom designed the interior. Ferrari has handled the powertrain engineering and exterior design internally. The collaboration focuses specifically on the cockpit experience—which is exactly where Ive's Apple expertise translates best.

## The Bottom Line

The Ferrari Luce isn't just an electric car. It's a statement piece. A glimpse into what happens when Italian passion meets Silicon Valley precision. A hint of the Apple Car that never was.

And maybe, just maybe, it's proof that the transition to electric vehicles doesn't mean sacrificing the things that make driving special.

We'll know more when Ferrari reveals the exterior in May. Until then, we'll be here thinking about that magical key fob and those butterfly-valve air vents.

The future of Ferrari glows. And it's called Luce.
