The internet lost its collective mind when Spanish figure skater Tomàs-Llorenç Guarino Sabaté announced he might not be able to perform his beloved Minions-themed routine at the 2026 Winter Olympics. For a brief, terrifying moment, the world faced the prospect of an Olympics without those adorable yellow henchmen gliding across the ice.

Spoiler alert: the Minions made it. But the journey to get there exposes a chaotic, confusing mess at the heart of competitive figure skating that affects everyone from Olympic hopefuls to superstars.

## What Is the Minions Figure Skating Program?

If you haven't seen it yet, you're in for a treat. Sabaté's short program is a full-on tribute to the *Despicable Me* franchise. He skates to a medley of Minions music while dressed head-to-toe like one of Gru's chaotic yellow creatures. It's weird, wonderful, and absolutely impossible not to smile at.

The 26-year-old Spaniard has been performing this crowd-pleaser all season, building a devoted following among figure skating fans who were eagerly anticipating its Olympic debut. He finished 20th at last year's world championships—not exactly medal territory—but his Minions routine turned him into one of the most talked-about skaters heading into Milano Cortina.

Then, less than two weeks before his Olympic performance, everything nearly fell apart.

## The Copyright Crisis That Shocked the Skating World

On Monday, February 2nd, Sabaté dropped a bombshell: Universal Studios, which owns the rights to all things Minions, hadn't cleared his music for Olympic use. Despite skating to the same songs all season with what he believed was proper approval through ClicknClear—a licensing platform the International Skating Union partners with—the studio suddenly wanted more details about his music and costume.

The timing couldn't have been worse. The men's short program was scheduled for February 10th. Sabaté was staring down the very real possibility of having to scrap months of preparation and perform something completely different on the world's biggest stage.

"I told people they were gonna see the minions of the Olympics, and I don't want to be a liar," U.S. skater Amber Glenn said, echoing the disappointment felt across the skating community.

## How Sabaté Fought to Save His Olympic Dream

What followed was a frantic scramble involving international negotiations, last-minute phone calls, and the kind of behind-the-scenes chaos you'd expect from a Hollywood movie—not an Olympic figure skating competition.

Sabaté needed approval for four separate pieces of music. Here's how the rescue mission unfolded:

**Songs 1 & 2:** Quickly cleared through renewed negotiations with Universal Pictures.

**Song 3:** Sabaté personally reached out to the Spanish artist who created the track. Direct artist-to-athlete communication saved the day.

**Song 4 ("Freedom" by Pharrell Williams):** This was the holdout. The master recording rights sat with Sony Music under a restricted deal. ClicknClear founder Chantal Epps went on what she described as a "wild goose chase" trying to reach someone with actual authority to approve the license.

While negotiations dragged on, Sabaté began practicing his backup—a Bee Gees-inspired program from last season. Just in case.

Finally, on Friday, February 6th—just hours before the Olympic figure skating program kicked off with the team event—the final approval came through.

"I'm so happy to announce that we've done it! We've secured the licenses for all four songs, and I'll be able to skate the Minions at the Olympic Games," Sabaté wrote on social media. "It hasn't been an easy process, but the support of everyone who has followed my case has been key to keeping me motivated and optimistic these past few days."

## Why Music Copyright Is Figure Skating's Biggest Headache

Sabaté's near-disaster isn't an isolated incident. It's the symptom of a systemic problem that has plagued figure skating ever since the International Skating Union allowed music with lyrics in 2014.

Before that rule change, skaters mostly used classical and instrumental pieces—music that was often in the public domain or easy to license. When modern pop songs entered the picture, things got complicated fast.

Here's the issue: figuring out who actually owns a piece of music is surprisingly difficult. Sometimes it's the record label. Sometimes it's the artist. Often, it's multiple parties with different rights to different aspects of the same song. Skaters frequently piece together medleys from various sources, multiplying the complexity.

The ISU partnered with ClicknClear to streamline the process, but even that hasn't solved the problem. Artists sometimes don't know their own labels have approved a license. Labels sometimes don't communicate with each other. And companies like Universal can decide at the last minute that they want more information before granting approval.

"It's been a very strenuous process for many of us," Glenn admitted. "First we get a website or some sort of application to track things. And then once we're like, 'OK, yeah, it's cleared. It's good,' then it's not a reliable source anymore."

## Other Skaters Hit by Copyright Chaos at Milano Cortina

Sabaté wasn't the only athlete caught in the copyright crossfire at these Games:

**Petr Gumennik (Russia):** The Russian national champion had to change his music just two days before competition. He'd been skating to music from *Perfume: The Story of a Murderer* all season, only to discover he lacked proper permission. He couldn't even fall back on last year's *Dune* soundtrack in time. He ended up pivoting to "Waltz 1805" by Edgar Hakobyan.

**Loena Hendrickx (Belgium):** The two-time world medalist grew concerned that her Celine Dion song "Ashes" from *Deadpool 2* wouldn't get approved. She switched to "I Surrender"—another Dion track with similar rhythm—at the last minute after the European championships.

**Amber Glenn (USA):** Canadian artist Seb McKinnon publicly objected on social media after discovering Glenn had been skating to his song "The Return" for two years without his knowledge. Plot twist: his label had actually approved it without telling him. The situation resolved happily, with McKinnon congratulating Glenn on her team gold and Glenn calling it "the start of an unexpected friendship."

## How Skaters Are Fighting Back

Top skaters have started taking matters into their own hands. U.S. star Ilia Malinin makes it a point to reach out directly to artists whenever possible.

"I always try to reach out to whoever's in charge of that decision for music, and especially, I like to reach out to the artist directly," Malinin said. "Try that as an option, and most of the time, it usually works out in my favor."

Alysa Liu, the reigning world champion, has a public friendship with Laufey, whose song "Promise" she skates to. After Liu performed in the team event, Laufey posted a TikTok celebrating "OUR olympian alysa liu."

As for Glenn's Madonna situation? She hasn't heard from the Queen of Pop about "Like a Prayer"—but she recently noticed Madonna follows her on Instagram. And if Madonna did object? "If I do get a message from Madonna saying she doesn't want me to skate to her music, I mean, I'll just be excited to get a message from Madonna," Glenn joked.

## When to Watch the Minions Take the Olympic Ice

Sabaté's moment finally arrives on Tuesday, February 10th (already underway as of this writing). The men's short program kicks off at 11:30 a.m. CT, with the Spanish skater expected to perform fourth in the lineup.

He's not a medal favorite—but after everything he went through to get here, he'll have the entire skating world cheering him on.

"Right now, I just want to give my all on the ice and perform a program worthy of the love I've received from around the world," Sabaté said. "I'm thrilled by the love that a small skater from a small federation has received."

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why was the Minions figure skating music almost banned from the Olympics?

Universal Pictures, which owns the Minions franchise, initially didn't clear the music for Olympic use. Despite Sabaté using ClicknClear's licensing platform all season, Universal requested additional details about his music and costume. The final holdup was "Freedom" by Pharrell Williams, which required special approval from Sony Music.

### What is ClicknClear in figure skating?

ClicknClear is a licensing platform that the International Skating Union partners with to help skaters obtain permission to use copyrighted music. It works with record labels and publishers to pre-clear songs for competition use. However, as the Minions controversy shows, the system isn't foolproof.

### When did figure skating allow music with lyrics?

The International Skating Union changed its rules in 2014 to allow music with vocals in competitive programs. Before this, skaters were limited to instrumental and classical pieces. The rule change opened up creative possibilities but also created significant copyright challenges that the sport is still struggling to address.

## The Bigger Picture

The Minions saga has a happy ending, but it exposed cracks in a system that leaves Olympic athletes scrambling at the worst possible moments. ISU president Jae Youl Kim acknowledged the severity: "It is a very, very, very serious problem. We don't want athletes to be worried about the music."

For now, skaters continue to navigate a licensing landscape that feels more like a minefield than a support system. The ones who succeed often do so by building direct relationships with artists—a workaround that shouldn't be necessary but has become essential.

As for Sabaté? He's just grateful the world gets to see his yellow-suited tribute to cinema's most chaotic creatures.

"I want to thank ClicknClear and the RFEDH, as well as Universal Pictures, Pharrell Williams, Sony Music and Juan Alcaraz for managing the rights in such a short time so I can perform my program in Milan," he said.

Sometimes, even in the middle of Olympic pressure and corporate bureaucracy, the Minions win.
