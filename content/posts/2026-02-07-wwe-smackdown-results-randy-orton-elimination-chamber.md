**WWE SmackDown results** from February 6, 2026, delivered a night that will go down in wrestling history. Randy Orton, the Apex Predator himself, punched his ticket to the Elimination Chamber Match by defeating Aleister Black and Solo Sikoa in a Triple Threat Qualifying Match. But this wasn't just any qualification — it marked Orton's **10th Elimination Chamber appearance**, cementing a record that may never be broken.

The road to WrestleMania just got a whole lot more interesting.

## Randy Orton Qualifies for Historic 10th Elimination Chamber Match

The main event delivered everything fans could ask for. Three dangerous competitors. High stakes. And vintage Randy Orton doing what he does best.

The match saw Orton face off against Aleister Black and Solo Sikoa in a qualifying bout for the Elimination Chamber Match scheduled for Saturday, February 28. Earlier in the night, Solo Sikoa had been searching for his MFT stablemates, but they were nowhere to be found. Ominously, the screen flickered — a telltale sign that the Wyatt Sicks may have had something to do with their mysterious absence.

When the bell rang, all three men threw everything they had at each other. Orton connected with a devastating RKO on Aleister Black, but Black managed to roll out of the ring before he could be pinned. Solo Sikoa saw his opportunity. He positioned himself behind Orton, ready to deliver the Samoan Spike the moment the Viper turned around.

But Randy Orton has been doing this for over two decades. Instead of turning into Sikoa's trap, Orton launched another RKO — seemingly out of nowhere — and planted Sikoa for the winning pinfall.

The crowd erupted. WWE's Apex Predator had done it again.

## Tiffany Stratton Wins Women's Elimination Chamber Qualifier

The women's Elimination Chamber Qualifying Match kicked off the night's championship-caliber action. Former WWE Women's Champion Tiffany Stratton squared off against Lash Legend and Chelsea Green, with Nia Jax at ringside for Legend and Alba Fyre backing up Green.

The match was chaotic from the start. Chelsea Green nearly stole the victory with a devastating coast-to-coast that connected with both Stratton and Legend. She went for the cover on Legend, but Nia Jax yanked her out of the ring before the three-count.

The ringside brawl that followed saw Green eventually send Stratton back into the ring. Green went for the Unprettier, but Stratton reversed it beautifully, setting up for the Prettiest Moonsault Ever. She connected, made the cover, and secured her spot in the Elimination Chamber.

## Drew McIntyre Under Siege: Cody Rhodes and Jacob Fatu Attack

Undisputed WWE Champion Drew McIntyre had one of the worst nights of his reign — and he didn't even have a match.

The show opened with Cody Rhodes launching a sneak attack on McIntyre. The American Nightmare was still fuming after The Scottish Psychopath cost him his shot at winning the 2026 Royal Rumble. Rhodes didn't mince words: he declared that Drew McIntyre wouldn't make it to WrestleMania.

But Cody wasn't the only one with unfinished business.

Later in the night, Jacob Fatu, the Samoan Werewolf, unleashed a vicious assault on McIntyre — the champion's second beatdown of the evening. Add in Trick Williams stepping up to McIntyre backstage, informing him that he's the only Superstar the champ should be worried about, and you've got a target painted squarely on Drew's back.

The WrestleMania picture is getting crowded — and dangerous.

## RHIYO Successfully Defend WWE Women's Tag Team Championship

WWE Women's Tag Team Champions Rhea Ripley and IYO SKY — collectively known as RHIYO — successfully defended their titles against Women's United States Champion Giulia and Kiana James.

The match was a hard-fought battle between four of the most talented women on the roster. In the end, Ripley and SKY connected with their signature Riptide/Over the Moonsault combination on Giulia to retain their championship gold.

## Other Notable SmackDown Results

The rest of Friday Night SmackDown delivered plenty of action:

- **Carmelo Hayes def. The Miz** — The United States Champion avoided The Miz's Skull-Crushing Finale and hit the First 48 for the non-title victory.

- **Oba Femi def. Kit Wilson** — After Wilson complained about the "toxic nature" of the Royal Rumble Match, Oba Femi emerged to destroy him in an impromptu squash match.

- **Tama Tonga def. Shinsuke Nakamura** — The MFTs interfered to help Tama Tonga hit the Cutthroat for an underhanded victory.

- **Liv Morgan & Raquel Rodriguez def. Jade Cargill & Jordynne Grace** — In a chaotic tag team match, accidental friendly fire from both teams led to confusion. When Cargill accidentally kicked Grace and Rodriguez took out Morgan, Jordynne Grace rolled up Raquel Rodriguez for the pin. Wait — that means Jade Cargill's team actually won. The Royal Rumble winner Liv Morgan left with more questions than answers heading into WrestleMania season.
