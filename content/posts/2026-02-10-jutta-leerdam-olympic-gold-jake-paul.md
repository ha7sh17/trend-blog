Jutta Leerdam just proved she's way more than Jake Paul's fiancée. The Dutch speedskating sensation captured Olympic gold in the women's 1000 meters at the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Games on Monday, upgrading the silver medal she won in Beijing four years ago to the sport's ultimate prize.

With tears streaming down her face after crossing the finish line, Leerdam cemented her status as one of the greatest speedskaters of her generation. And yes, Jake Paul was there in the second row, decked out in Dutch orange, watching every stride.

## From Silver to Gold: Jutta Leerdam's Olympic Journey

The 27-year-old from the Netherlands has been building toward this moment for years. At the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, Leerdam took home a silver medal in the 1000 meters and finished fifth in the 500. While impressive, she knew she had more to give.

Her trophy case tells a remarkable story: 12 world championship medals, including six golds. Two of those world titles came in the 1000 meters — in 2020 and 2023. Coming into Milan, she'd won three of the four World Cup 1000-meter races she entered this season, making her the heavy favorite.

The Milano Speed Skating Stadium was awash in orange as Dutch fans packed the venue. According to tradition, the color represents the House of Orange, the Dutch Royal Family. But on this night, it was all about their speedskating queen.

## Jake Paul Watches Fiancée Win Olympic Gold

YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul took his seat in the second row before the race, wearing a scarf in Dutch orange draped over his shoulders. He walked past reporters without answering questions, keeping the spotlight exactly where it belonged — on Leerdam.

The couple posted news about their engagement on Instagram back in March 2025, and the internet has been fascinated with them ever since. Paul, 29, brings his own massive following to the relationship — his Instagram boasts more than 28 million followers to Leerdam's 5 million. Combined, they're one of the most-followed couples in sports and entertainment.

Paul's boxing career has had its ups and downs. His most recent bout ended with a sixth-round knockout loss to former heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua in Miami last December, suffering a broken jaw in the process. He's previously fought Mike Tyson, Julio Cesar Chavez Jr., and retired UFC fighters Anderson Silva and Nate Díaz.

Earlier at these Olympics, Paul was spotted sitting with U.S. Vice President JD Vance at a women's hockey game where Team USA defeated Finland 5-0.

## The "World's Hottest Athlete" Controversy

Before she even took to the ice, Leerdam was making headlines for reasons beyond speedskating. The Daily Mail dubbed her the "World's Hottest Athlete" at the 2026 Winter Games, a title that comes with its own complicated baggage.

"Jutta Leerdam may have been thrust into the spotlight thanks to her romance with renowned YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul, but the blonde beauty has made a name for herself in her own right," the outlet wrote.

But the glamour also invited criticism. Dutch reporter Johan Derksen didn't hold back, accusing Leerdam of "diva" behavior.

"Her behavior is horrible to me, like that of a diva. If I were her coach, I wouldn't tolerate that," Derksen said. "Gradually the whole of the Netherlands is starting to get a bit fed up with her behavior."

The complaints centered on Leerdam arriving at the Olympics on a private jet and in a private car, separate from her teammates. She also skipped the Opening Ceremony, drawing further criticism.

"A private jet really sets a bad example for your fans," one fan wrote on social media. "There is still less and less natural ice due to the climate crisis."

## Setting the Record Straight on the Ice

None of the noise mattered when it came time to race. Leerdam was placed in the 15th and final pairing, skating against Japan's Miho Takagi. The pressure was immense — the competition featured world-class talent including her Dutch teammate Femke Kok, who set an Olympic record earlier in the event.

American stars Erin Jackson, the 500-meter defending champion, and Brittany Bowe, the world record holder, represented Team USA's best hopes. Jackson, who became the first Black American to win a gold in an individual event at the Winter Olympics in Beijing, finished strong but couldn't match the Dutch firepower.

Track legend Allyson Felix, who won 11 Olympic medals including seven golds in her storied career, was among the spectators watching history unfold.

## What's Next for Jutta Leerdam at Milan 2026

The gold medal in the 1000 meters is just the beginning for Leerdam at these Games. She's scheduled to compete in the 500 meters on February 15, where she'll face off against defending Olympic champion Erin Jackson.

Given her form this season and the confidence that comes with Olympic gold, Leerdam will enter that race as a serious medal contender. A second medal would further cement her legacy and prove that her arrival at the top of speedskating is no fluke.
