On February 7, 2026, Jackie Robinson would have turned 107 years old. Across the United States, from school gymnasiums in Salem, Massachusetts to baseball stadiums nationwide, Americans are pausing to remember the man who changed not just baseball, but America itself.

## More Than Just a Baseball Player

When most people hear Jackie Robinson's name, they think of baseball. And rightfully so—on April 15, 1947, Robinson became the first African American to play Major League Baseball in the modern era, breaking the notorious color barrier while wearing uniform No. 42 for the Brooklyn Dodgers.

But reducing Robinson to his baseball achievements misses the larger picture. As Darnell McDonald, former MLB player and first-round draft pick, puts it: "It wasn't about the baseball. And that's really what I admired most about Jackie Robinson."

## A Legacy That Extends Far Beyond the Diamond

Before baseball, Robinson was UCLA's first four-sport letter winner and served in the U.S. Army during World War II. After his playing career ended, he became a vice president at a Fortune 500 company, founded a bank and housing development company, advised politicians, and emerged as a key figure in the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 60s.

In 2005, Robinson was posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal—the nation's highest civilian award bestowed by Congress.

## Teaching the Next Generation

At Collins Middle School in Salem, Massachusetts, nearly 500 seventh and eighth graders gathered for the 23rd annual Jackie Robinson Celebration of Life. The event featured former Red Sox players Sam Horn, Darnell McDonald, and Manny Delcarmen, along with other notable figures connected to Robinson's legacy.

What struck the former players was how few students initially knew about Robinson beyond his name. Eighth grader Melany Vasquez admitted she "didn't know much about Jackie Robinson" before the event—she'd heard his name and knew he was important, but the details of his significance were fuzzy.

This knowledge gap is precisely why these celebrations matter.

## Perseverance Against Impossible Odds

Sam Horn, a 1982 first-round Red Sox draft pick, emphasized Robinson's most enduring quality: perseverance. "He was the epitome of someone who wanted to reach their goals, would not give up, and basically a good role model to follow as far as trying to achieve something."

Robinson faced horrific racism both on and off the field during his career. Opponents hurled slurs, pitchers threw at his head, and fans sent death threats. Through it all, he maintained his composure and let his play speak for itself—Rookie of the Year in 1947 and MVP in 1949.

## The Number That Lives Forever

In 1997, Major League Baseball took the unprecedented step of retiring Robinson's number 42 across all teams—the only player in history to receive this honor. Every April 15, players throughout MLB wear 42 to commemorate Jackie Robinson Day.

McDonald wore 42 in high school specifically to honor Robinson. "I would have worn it in professional baseball if that was an option," he said. His admiration ran so deep that UCLA became his dream school simply because Robinson had attended there.

## Why It Still Matters in 2026

Nearly 80 years after Robinson broke the color barrier, his story remains urgently relevant. In an era of continued conversations about racial justice, equality, and breaking barriers, Robinson serves as both inspiration and reminder.

Delcarmen hopes the students he spoke to will dig deeper: "Really I'm hoping that they go back and actually see the movie '42', read a book, and really see what he went through to get us to this point."

Because understanding Jackie Robinson isn't just about knowing baseball history—it's about understanding American history. And that's a lesson worth celebrating every February 7th.
