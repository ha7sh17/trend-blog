Eddie the Eagle just dropped a bombshell in a new interview: he could only see during 70% of his Olympic ski jumps. His glasses fogged up constantly, and sometimes he'd wipe them *mid-flight* while soaring through the air at terrifying speeds.

If that doesn't sum up the absurd, wonderful, impossible story of Michael "Eddie the Eagle" Edwards, nothing will.

With the 2026 Winter Olympics underway in Milan-Cortina, the legendary British ski jumper is back in the spotlight—and his story hits different now than it did 38 years ago.

## Who Is Eddie the Eagle? The Man Behind the Legend

Eddie the Eagle wasn't supposed to be an Olympian. He wasn't supposed to be a ski jumper at all.

Born Michael Edwards in Cheltenham, England, he was a plasterer who fell in love with snow sports after just three one-hour skiing lessons at the Gloucestershire Ski Centre. As a teenager, he competed in Alpine skiing and slalom racing, but the costs were brutal—£200 per day to train.

Then someone told him about ski jumping. Cost? £3.50 a day.

"I was always up for a dare," Edwards recently told BBC Sport. "If anybody ever dared me to do something I would go and do it. Skiing and ski jumping was just perfect for that kind of mindset."

At 22, with zero experience and coaches telling him he'd never jump far, Edwards started training. He went from 30-meter jumps to 100 meters, proving everyone wrong at every step.

## The Impossible Road to Calgary 1988

Here's the thing about Eddie the Eagle that most people don't know: he had only 22 months of ski jumping experience before the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics.

Let that sink in.

When he asked the British Ski Federation what it would take to qualify, they said he needed to jump 50 meters in a World Cup competition. He did his first World Cup event just 10 months after putting on jumping skis—and he'd only done *two* 120-meter jumps in his entire life at that point.

Every time Edwards met a target, they raised it higher. "In a way, they were just trying to make me jump further and push me," he recalls. "It was only until five weeks before Calgary that I got the letter to say, 'Congratulations, you're going.'"

He trained in borrowed equipment. His first helmet was held together with string. His boots didn't fit. During one training period in Lake Placid, he slept in a cow shed and ate food from bins because he couldn't afford anything else.

There was no funding, no sponsorship, no support. Just Eddie and his determination.

## The Calgary Olympics: Last Place, First in Hearts

At the 1988 Calgary Games, Eddie the Eagle became the first competitor to represent Great Britain in Olympic ski jumping. He finished last in both the 70-meter and 90-meter events.

On paper, that sounds like failure. Critics at the time called it "a flop" and "a super flop."

But here's what they missed: Eddie Edwards set a British record with his jumps. He competed against athletes who'd been training since childhood, with world-class equipment and national funding, and he held his own well enough to finish the competition.

And that jump in front of 82,000 people in the stadium, with hundreds of millions watching worldwide? That became one of the most iconic moments in Olympic history.

"The whole two weeks were so special," Edwards told GB News recently. "I remember it like it was yesterday."

## The Fogged Glasses and Other Absurd Details

Eddie the Eagle's thick glasses became part of his signature look—the nerdy Brit flying through the air while better-equipped athletes shook their heads. But those glasses weren't just for show.

"For about 30% of my jumps I could not see," Edwards revealed. His glasses would steam up right before takeoff, and there was no time to wipe them clear.

"I could just make out which way up I was looking from the snow and the blue sky," he explained. "I thought, 'Well there's blue up there so I'm supposed to be the right way up', so I was able to land."

Sometimes, on the bigger jumps, he'd have enough flight time to stick his finger up and wipe his glasses while airborne. *While airborne.*

This is either the most terrifying or the most hilarious Olympic detail ever, depending on your perspective.

## Eddie the Eagle's Legacy in 2026

For years after Calgary, Eddie Edwards was treated as a punchline—the guy who came last, the amateur who didn't belong. The International Olympic Committee even introduced what became known as the "Eddie the Eagle Rule" to prevent future athletes without competitive backgrounds from qualifying.

But something shifted in 2016 when the biographical film "Eddie the Eagle" hit theaters, starring Taron Egerton. Suddenly, people saw the full picture: the poverty, the sacrifice, the years of being told "you can't do this."

"It wasn't until the film came out that they really looked into my story," Edwards said, "and they realised that for me, getting to those Olympic Games was my gold medal."

Now 62, Edwards is viewed differently. The words people use have changed: resilience, tenacity, determination.

He held the British ski jumping record from 1988 to 2001. He went on to set a stunt jumping world record by clearing six buses in a single jump. He became a motivational speaker, appeared in countless documentaries, and remains one of the most recognizable Winter Olympic figures ever.

## What Eddie the Eagle Means for the 2026 Winter Olympics

With the Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics currently underway, Eddie Edwards has been doing media rounds, and his message resonates more than ever.

In a world of hyper-optimized athletes with million-dollar training programs, sports science teams, and corporate sponsors, Eddie the Eagle represents something raw and human: the idea that showing up and trying matters, even if you come in last.

"The worst thing that people can say to me is 'you can't do it'," Edwards said, "because that to me is just like a red rag to a bull—I'm thinking 'well I'm going to prove to you that we can do it'."

He even suggested that modern freestyle events might have suited his original "daredevil" style better than traditional ski jumping. Somewhere in an alternate timeline, Eddie the Eagle is doing backflips in the halfpipe.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Did Eddie the Eagle ever win any medals?

No, Eddie the Eagle did not win any Olympic medals. He finished last in both the 70m and 90m ski jumping events at the 1988 Calgary Olympics. However, he did set a British ski jumping record that stood from 1988 to 2001, and he considers simply qualifying for the Olympics his personal "gold medal."

### Why is Eddie the Eagle so famous if he lost?

Eddie the Eagle became famous precisely because of his underdog story. He trained for less than two years, funded himself, used borrowed equipment, and competed against athletes with lifelong training. His determination and good-humored approach captured the hearts of millions worldwide. His story represents the Olympic spirit of participation and perseverance over winning.

### Is the Eddie the Eagle movie accurate?

The 2016 film "Eddie the Eagle" starring Taron Egerton captures the essence of his journey, though some details were dramatized for Hollywood. The core story—a self-funded British plasterer who taught himself ski jumping and made it to the Olympics against all odds—is true. Edwards himself has said the film helped people finally understand what his achievement really meant.

## The Eagle Still Soars

Thirty-eight years after Calgary, Eddie the Eagle remains proof that the Olympic dream isn't just about gold medals and world records. Sometimes it's about a guy with fogged-up glasses, string holding his helmet together, who looked at a 90-meter ski jump and thought, "Yeah, I can do that."

He couldn't see. He didn't have proper gear. He came in dead last.

And he's still one of the most beloved Olympic athletes of all time.

For fans looking to relive the magic, Edwards recommends the Retro Winter Olympic Series, currently available on the Really app, which features his story alongside other past athletes.

As for what's next? At 62, Eddie the Eagle says he wants to ski a black run for his birthday. Because of course he does.

Some eagles never stop flying.
