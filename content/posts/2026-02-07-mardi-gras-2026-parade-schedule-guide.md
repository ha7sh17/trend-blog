Mardi Gras 2026 is officially in full swing, and if you're not already planning your trip to New Orleans or Mobile, you might want to start packing your bags. With daily parades now rolling through the streets and Fat Tuesday just ten days away, this year's Carnival season promises to be nothing short of spectacular.

Whether you're a seasoned bead-catching veteran or a first-time visitor wondering what all the fuss is about, this comprehensive guide has everything you need to make the most of Mardi Gras 2026.

## When Is Fat Tuesday 2026?

The big question on everyone's mind: **Fat Tuesday 2026 falls on February 17th**. But here's the thing that surprises many first-timers—Mardi Gras isn't just one day. Carnival season technically begins on January 6th (Twelfth Night) and builds up to an absolute crescendo on Fat Tuesday.

## Mobile Mardi Gras 2026: America's Original Celebration

Here's a fun fact that might ruffle some feathers in New Orleans: Mobile, Alabama actually hosts America's oldest Mardi Gras celebration. The tradition here dates back to 1703, predating New Orleans by over a decade.

Mobile's Carnival season is already heating up. The Order of Polka Dots rolled through downtown on Thursday night with their "Cocktails and Dreams" theme, drawing an impressive crowd of over 25,000 despite temperatures in the low 40s. That's dedication to the Carnival spirit!

### Upcoming Mobile Parades

- **Friday, February 6:** Order of Inca (downtown Mobile), Apollo's Mystic Ladies (Daphne)
- **Saturday, February 7:** Afternoon and evening parades in Mobile, Mystic Mutts of Revelry pet parade, Knights of Ecor Rouge (Fairhope)
- **Sunday, February 8:** Neptune's Daughters, Order of Isis (Mobile), Order of Misfits (Robertsdale)

Daily parades will continue through Fat Tuesday, with only Wednesday, February 11 as a potential make-up date for rained-out parades.

## What Makes Mardi Gras 2026 Special?

### Celebrity Sightings

New Orleans Saints defensive legend Cam Jordan will serve as co-grand marshal for one of the major parades this year. Celebrities traditionally ride with the super krewes like Endymion, Bacchus, and Orpheus, so keep your eyes peeled for familiar faces.

### Trending Throws for 2026

Forget your grandmother's plastic beads. This year's hottest throws include:

- **Light-up items:** LED-enhanced throws are dominating the scene
- **Sustainable options:** Eco-friendly throws are gaining serious traction
- **Holiday-themed items:** Creative crossover designs mixing Carnival with other celebrations
- **Krewe-specific signature throws:** The Muses shoes remain the most coveted catch

### The Food Scene

King cake season is in full effect, and bakeries across Louisiana are pulling out all the stops. Beyond the traditional ring-shaped cakes, you'll find king cake beignets, king cake nachos, and even king cake eggrolls at various hotspots around New Orleans.

## Mardi Gras 2026 Insider Tips

**1. Pick Your Parade Route Wisely**
St. Charles Avenue is the classic viewing spot, but it gets packed. Magazine Street offers a more local vibe, while the French Quarter hosts smaller, walking parades with a completely different atmosphere.

**2. Arrive Early for Big Parades**
For super krewes like Endymion, Bacchus, and Rex, serious parade-goers stake out spots hours in advance. Bring chairs, snacks, and patience.

**3. Dress in Layers**
February weather in Louisiana is unpredictable. This year, evening temperatures have been dipping into the 40s, so come prepared.

**4. Cash Is Still King**
Street vendors, parking lots, and many local establishments prefer cash. ATMs get crowded and sometimes run out during peak times.

**5. Stay Safe**
The party atmosphere is infectious, but pace yourself. Stay hydrated, stick with your group, and be aware of your surroundings.
