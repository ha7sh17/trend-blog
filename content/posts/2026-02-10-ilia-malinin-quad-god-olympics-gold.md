The 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics just witnessed one of the most dramatic moments in figure skating history. **Ilia Malinin**, the 21-year-old phenomenon known as the "Quad God," delivered a clutch performance that secured Team USA's gold medal in the figure skating team event.

## Ilia Malinin Delivers Under Pressure at 2026 Olympics

The pressure couldn't have been higher. After carrying a five-point lead into the final day, the Americans found themselves tied with Japan entering the men's free skate—the last segment of the competition. Everything came down to Malinin's blades.

"I was more nervous watching Ilia than I was skating myself," admitted U.S. team captain Danny O'Shea.

And Malinin delivered. The two-time reigning world champion executed five quadruple jumps while his own voice blared over the loudspeaker as part of his "The Voice" music program. The crowd at Milano erupted.

## The Quad God's Legendary Backflip Stuns Djokovic

What made the performance unforgettable wasn't just the technical brilliance—it was the showmanship. Late in his program, Malinin performed his now-signature backflip, a move that had tennis legend **Novak Djokovic** jumping to his feet in the stands.

"What?" Djokovic exclaimed, his hands on his head in disbelief.

Malinin earned a stunning **200.03 points**, sending his teammates rushing to embrace him on the kiss-and-cry podium. But the drama wasn't over yet.

## USA vs Japan: A Nail-Biting 69-68 Victory

Japan's Shun Sato took the ice next, determined to snatch gold from the Americans. He landed three quad jumps of his own with a clean skate—but it wasn't enough. Sato scored 194.86 points, leaving Japan one point short.

**Final score: United States 69, Japan 68.**

"We came here to do one job, and we achieved it," Malinin said after the victory.

Italy claimed the bronze medal with 60 points, marking just the third Olympic medal in figure skating for the host nation—an emotional moment for the home crowd.

## Team USA's Unsung Heroes: Chock, Bates, Kam, and O'Shea

While Malinin grabbed the headlines, the gold medal was a true team effort.

**Madison Chock and Evan Bates**, the three-time reigning ice dance world champions, were the only members of both the 2022 and 2026 teams. They dominated both the short program and free dance, contributing a crucial 20 points to the American total.

**Ellie Kam and Danny O'Shea** emerged as unlikely heroes in the pairs event. After finishing fifth in the short program, they delivered one of the best performances of their career in the free skate, finishing fourth and preventing Japan from closing the gap.

"That was our goal—maybe taking one or two points of pressure off the rest of Team USA," O'Shea explained. "And we did a little bit more for that today."

## Amber Glenn Battles First-Time Olympic Nerves

Three-time national champion **Amber Glenn** made her Olympic debut in the women's free skate. Despite struggling early—spinning out of her triple axel and having trouble with jumping combinations—she rallied in the second half.

"I did not feel or perform the way I wanted to," Glenn admitted. "I physically didn't feel great. My legs were feeling heavy."

She finished third with 138.62 points, but her gutsy performance helped maintain Team USA's position.

## Redemption for 2022: Finally Celebrating on the Podium

This gold medal carried extra significance. In 2022, the Americans initially finished second in the team event, with the Russian Olympic Committee winning gold. However, the Russian team was later disqualified due to a positive drug test.

The Americans finally received their 2022 medals more than two years later—at the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics.

This time, Madison Chock and Evan Bates got to celebrate on the podium immediately, experiencing the moment they were robbed of four years ago.

## The Skate Controversy: Podium Damages Blades

Not everything went perfectly after the victory. In an unusual twist, U.S. skaters had their blades damaged during the medal ceremony.

The problem? The medal podium wasn't covered with carpet or a soft surface, leading to scratches and potential damage to the skates. Typically, skaters put on guards whenever they're off the ice, but guards weren't available for the podium celebration.

It's unclear how severe the damage was, but changing skates mid-Olympics is a nightmare scenario for any skater.
