# LeBron James All-NBA Streak Ends: The Historic 21-Year Run That Defined Greatness

LeBron James' legendary 21-year All-NBA streak has officially come to an end. On Tuesday night, the Los Angeles Lakers ruled out their 41-year-old superstar against the San Antonio Spurs due to left foot arthritis, marking his 18th missed game of the season and making it mathematically impossible for him to reach the 65-game threshold required for NBA awards eligibility.

For the first time since his rookie season in 2003-04, the All-NBA teams will be announced without LeBron James' name among them.

## What Makes LeBron James' All-NBA Streak So Historic?

To truly appreciate what LeBron James accomplished, you need to understand just how far ahead of the competition he stands. The previous record for All-NBA selections was 15 — held by three of the greatest players in basketball history: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Kobe Bryant, and Tim Duncan.

That's 15 *total* selections for legends. LeBron had 21 *consecutive* years.

The streak began in 2004-05, LeBron's second NBA season. Since then, he has been recognized as one of the league's best players every single year through a span that saw:

- Five different U.S. presidents
- The rise and fall of countless NBA dynasties
- Three different teams (Cavaliers, Heat, Lakers)
- Four NBA championships
- Two different generations of basketball fans

LeBron is also the all-time leader in first-team All-NBA selections with 13, two more than Kobe Bryant and Karl Malone.

## Why LeBron James Missed the Spurs Game

The Lakers ruled James out of Tuesday's game citing left foot arthritis. This wasn't an isolated incident — the 41-year-old missed the first 14 games of the 2025-26 season due to sciatica after not participating in training camp.

At his age, playing both legs of back-to-back games has become increasingly difficult. LeBron himself has been candid about this reality, and the Lakers organization has carefully monitored his health to keep him fresh for the playoff push.

Despite the absences, James has been productive when he plays, averaging 21.7 points, 6.9 assists, and 5.7 rebounds over 34 games this season.

## The Lakers' Injury Nightmare Continues

LeBron wasn't the only star missing from Tuesday's 136-108 loss to San Antonio. The Lakers were also without:

- **Luka Dončić** (left hamstring strain) — his third straight missed game
- **Austin Reaves** (left calf injury management)
- **Marcus Smart** (right ankle soreness)
- **Deandre Ayton** (right knee soreness)

Remarkably, the Lakers (32-20) remain in strong playoff position in the Western Conference despite their Big Three of James, Dončić, and Reaves appearing together in just 10 games all season.

Dončić himself is at risk of missing the 65-game threshold. With 11 games missed, he can only afford to sit out six more to remain awards eligible. The league's leading scorer participated in a 5-on-5 session with contact on Tuesday and hopes to play against his former team, the Dallas Mavericks, on Thursday.

## A Season of Ending Streaks for LeBron James

The All-NBA streak isn't the only unprecedented run that ended for LeBron this season. December 4th saw him score just eight points in a win against the Toronto Raptors, breaking a 1,297-game streak of scoring at least 10 points that dated back 19 years.

He also missed out on being named an All-Star starter for the first time in 21 years, though he remains an All-Star selection. Even as these individual milestones fall, one record continues to grow: LeBron is currently playing his 23rd NBA season, a feat no other player in league history has achieved.

## What the 65-Game Rule Means for NBA Awards

The 65-game threshold for awards eligibility was first adopted for the 2023-24 season, designed to incentivize players to take the court regularly. Lakers coach JJ Redick, who previously voted on awards during his media career, suggested the rule could be treated more as guidance than a strict cutoff.

"I think it's fine to have some sort of guidance for voters," Redick said before the game. "I know the first year that I voted, there were a bunch of guys that were in like that 54-to-56-game range."

Spurs coach Mitch Johnson supported the spirit of the rule while acknowledging its limitations.

"Playing games in this league over 82 games of just regular-season games is a lot, and it's tough," Johnson said. "I understand the intention of it. The details if 65 games is the right number... I honestly haven't given it much thought. I think it obviously stinks for guys who have really great years."

## LeBron James' Impact on the GOAT Debate

The end of the All-NBA streak will inevitably fuel the never-ending debate about basketball's greatest player. But whether you rank LeBron at number one or two (or anywhere else), his longevity stands alone in sports history.

Consider this: when LeBron made his first All-NBA team in 2005, Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan, Shaquille O'Neal, and Kobe Bryant were the first-team selections. Players like Tracy McGrady, Dirk Nowitzki, and Yao Ming filled out the other teams.

Every single one of those players has long since retired. LeBron kept making All-NBA teams.

As Yahoo Sports put it: "It's just hard to think of a single athlete in all of sports who has performed like this from ages 19 to 41."

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many All-NBA teams did LeBron James make in a row?

LeBron James made 21 consecutive All-NBA teams from 2005 to 2025, an NBA record. The previous record for total All-NBA selections was 15, held by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Kobe Bryant, and Tim Duncan.

### Why is LeBron James not eligible for All-NBA this year?

Under current NBA rules adopted in 2023-24, players must appear in at least 65 games to be eligible for postseason awards including All-NBA. LeBron's 18th missed game of the season made it mathematically impossible for him to reach that threshold.

### Is LeBron James retiring?

There is no indication that LeBron James is retiring. Despite the end of his All-NBA streak, he remains an effective player in his historic 23rd NBA season, averaging 21.7 points, 6.9 assists, and 5.7 rebounds per game.

## Looking Ahead: What's Next for LeBron and the Lakers

While the individual accolades have hit their limit this season, LeBron James' focus remains on team success. The Lakers sit at 32-20 and are positioned for a deep playoff run — if they can get healthy.

The hope is that LeBron, Dončić, and Reaves can finally log significant minutes together as the season progresses. With the All-Star break approaching (Dončić is still hoping to play in Sunday's game at Intuit Dome despite his injury), the Lakers will have time to regroup.

LeBron James' All-NBA streak may be over, but his career isn't. At 41, he continues to redefine what's possible for an aging athlete. The 21-year run was historic. What he does next could be just as memorable.
