When Madison Chock and Evan Bates took the ice at Milano's Ice Skating Arena on Friday, they weren't just performing—they were making history. The American ice dancing duo scored a jaw-dropping 91.06 points in the rhythm dance, shattering the world-best mark and sending a clear message to their competitors: the reigning champions aren't going anywhere.

## A Love Story Written in Gold

What makes Chock and Bates so captivating isn't just their technical brilliance—it's the fact that they're living proof that skating with your spouse can lead to Olympic glory. The married couple, who have been partners on the ice for over a decade, brought an electric energy to their Lenny Kravitz-inspired routine that had the crowd on their feet and Vice President JD Vance, along with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, cheering from the stands.

"We're not focused on that," Chock said when asked about the pressure of setting world records. "We're just doing what we do."

That understated confidence? It's precisely what separates the good from the great.

## From Michigan to the World Stage

The path to Olympic glory runs straight through Michigan for this dynamic duo. Bates, 36, was born in Ann Arbor and is part of a remarkable legacy—he's one of 53 members of his father's side of the family who graduated from the University of Michigan. Chock, 33, though born in Redondo Beach, California, graduated from Novi High School and has deep roots in the Great Lakes State.

For Bates, this marks his fifth Olympic Games. Let that sink in for a moment. In a sport where careers are often measured in single Olympic cycles, the Ann Arbor native has been competing at the highest level for nearly two decades. His longevity speaks to both his physical conditioning and his unwavering passion for the sport.

"We definitely skated great and we're very happy, as you saw when we finished," Bates said after the performance. "I think we both felt the excitement of just getting these Olympics underway. It's always a great feeling to do it for U.S."

## The Battle for Gold

The team competition at Milano Cortina is shaping up to be a two-horse race between the United States and Japan. With Chock and Bates securing the maximum 10 points for Team USA—while Japan's Utana Yoshida and Masaya Morita finished eighth—the Americans have grabbed an early and significant lead.

But the competition isn't just about national pride. Just minutes before Chock and Bates took the ice, French duo Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron had set their own world-best score of 89.98 points. For a brief moment, they held the crown. Then Chock and Bates proved why they're three-time world champions.

The message was clear: come at the kings, you best not miss.

## Team USA's Figure Skating Dominance

What makes the American figure skating team so formidable in 2026? It's depth. Alongside Chock and Bates, Team USA boasts Ellie Kam and Danny O'Shea in pairs, and perhaps most excitingly, the returning Alysa Liu.

Liu's story is one for the ages. The 20-year-old retired from skating at just 16, burned out from a childhood consumed by the demands of elite competition. But after two years away—during which she trekked to Everest Base Camp and rediscovered her love for life—she laced up her skates again. Last year, she shocked the world by winning the World Championship.

"My goal honestly is just to hype people up, give them an experience," Liu said ahead of the Games. "As long as people are feelin' some strong emotions and anticipation, I'm fine with that."

No American woman has won an Olympic figure skating singles title in 24 years. Liu could change that.

## The Only Holdovers

Perhaps the most telling statistic about Chock and Bates is this: they are the only members of the 2022 Beijing gold medal-winning team still competing. While their teammates have retired or moved on, Chock and Bates have continued to evolve, refine, and dominate.

Their longevity in a sport known for burning out young talent is a testament to their partnership—both on and off the ice. When you skate with your life partner, the chemistry isn't something you have to manufacture. It's real. It's visceral. And audiences can feel it.

## What's Next

The individual ice dancing competition later in these Games is where the real prize lies. Chock and Bates are the favorites, but the French team of Fournier Beaudry and Cizeron will be pushing them every step of the way.

For now, the American duo has accomplished exactly what they needed to: they've staked their claim as the team to beat, given the U.S. a commanding lead in the team competition, and reminded the world why they're three-time world champions.

As the Milano Cortina Games continue—with an opening ceremony featuring Mariah Carey, Laura Pausini, and Andrea Bocelli still to come—all eyes will be on the ice whenever Chock and Bates step onto it.

Because when you're watching them perform, you're not just watching figure skating. You're watching a love story unfold in real-time, set to music, performed at the highest level of athletic achievement the world has ever seen.

And honestly? That's pretty hard to look away from.
