The 2026 Winter Olympics biathlon events are officially underway in Anterselva, Italy, and the sport is already delivering drama, heartbreak, and triumph. France has claimed the first gold medal of the biathlon competition, while Team USA continues their quest to end a frustrating 66-year medal drought that stretches back to the sport's Olympic debut in 1960.

If you've been watching the Milano Cortina Games and wondering what exactly biathlon is—or why athletes are strapping rifles to their backs while skiing through the Italian Alps—you're not alone. This unique sport combines the endurance of cross-country skiing with the precision of rifle shooting, creating one of the most physically and mentally demanding events at the Winter Olympics.

## What Is Biathlon and How Does It Work?

Biathlon is unlike any other Olympic sport. Athletes strap .22-caliber long rifles to their backs and ski multiple laps around a cross-country track. After each lap, they arrive at a shooting zone where they must hit five targets from either a standing or prone position—all while their heart rate is through the roof from intense cardiovascular exertion.

Here's where it gets brutal: miss a target, and you're penalized. Depending on the event, a missed shot means either skiing a 490-foot penalty loop or having one minute added to your overall time. When races are often decided by seconds, these penalties can be race-ending.

The rifles used in biathlon must weigh at least 8 pounds and cannot be automatic or semi-automatic. Athletes manually load each round, adding another layer of skill to an already complex sport. Targets sit 50 meters away—roughly half a football field—and precision is everything.

## France Wins First Biathlon Gold at Milano Cortina 2026

France dominated the mixed relay biathlon event on February 8th, crossing the finish line in 1:04:15 to claim the first gold medal of the biathlon competition. The winning team of Eric Perrot, Quentin Fillon Maillet, Lou Jeanmonnot, and Julia Simon delivered a masterclass in both skiing speed and shooting accuracy.

Julia Simon, racing as the anchor, cleaned her final five targets and left the shooting range alone, securing the victory for her team. "I focused on myself and on what I need to do especially on the shooting range," Simon said after the race. "It was a really big moment for me and for us."

Italy thrilled their home crowd by taking silver, finishing just 25.8 seconds behind France. Dorothea Wierer admitted to pre-race nerves: "I was afraid and I had a little bit heavy legs also. I knew we had a strong team. It's just great for our team like this to begin the games."

Germany rounded out the podium with bronze, despite anchor Franziska Preuss needing one penalty loop on her final shooting stage.

## The Julia Simon Controversy: From Court to Olympic Gold

France's anchor Julia Simon entered the 2026 Winter Olympics with more than just athletic pressure on her shoulders. She's coming off a turbulent year that saw her receive a six-month ban from competition after being found guilty of theft and credit card fraud by a French court. She also received a three-month suspended prison sentence.

The French ski federation decided in November 2025 that Simon would be allowed to compete in the Winter Games despite the controversy. Her performance in the mixed relay—hitting all five targets under immense pressure—proved she could block out the noise and deliver when it mattered most.

Simon previously won a mixed relay silver medal at the 2022 Beijing Olympics and dominated the 2025 World Championships with four gold medals. Love her or loathe her, she remains one of the most talented biathletes in the world.

## Can Team USA Finally End Their 66-Year Biathlon Drought?

Here's a stunning statistic: The United States has won medals in every Winter Olympic sport—except biathlon. Since the sport debuted at the 1960 Squaw Valley Games, American biathletes have never stood on the Olympic podium. That's 66 years of trying.

Enter Campbell Wright, Team USA's best hope to rewrite history.

The 23-year-old has an unusual journey. He represented New Zealand at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics before switching to represent the United States in October 2023, leveraging his dual citizenship through his American-born parents. The move paid off spectacularly: Wright became the first U.S. biathlete to win two medals at a single World Championship, capturing back-to-back silver medals in the sprint and pursuit events in 2025.

In the mixed relay, the U.S. team of Maxime Germain, Campbell Wright, Deedra Irwin, and Margie Freed finished 14th. Wright missed one prone target, forcing a penalty lap that set the team back. But with individual events still ahead, Wright remains America's best chance at that elusive first medal.

Deedra Irwin, 33, is another athlete to watch. Her seventh-place finish in the women's 15km individual race at Beijing 2022 marked the best-ever Olympic finish for an American biathlete. She'll be looking to go even higher in Italy.

## Which Countries Dominate Olympic Biathlon?

Historically, Norway, Germany, and France have been the powerhouses of Olympic biathlon. France's dominance continued at the 2025 World Championships, where they won six gold medals and 13 total medals—more than any other country.

Norway followed with nine medals, Germany with five, and Sweden with four.

Quentin Fillon Maillet made history at the 2022 Beijing Olympics by becoming the first biathlete to win five medals at a single Winter Games: two golds (individual and pursuit) and three silvers (sprint, relay, and mixed relay). His experience and proven clutch performance make France the team to beat throughout the 2026 competition.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What kind of gun do they use in biathlon?

Athletes use .22-caliber long rifles that must weigh at least 8 pounds. The rifles cannot be automatic or semi-automatic—each round must be manually loaded. Rifles are often custom-fitted to each athlete and are worn on their backs while skiing.

### Why has the U.S. never won a biathlon medal?

Biathlon requires a combination of elite cross-country skiing endurance and precision marksmanship—two disciplines that don't naturally overlap in American athletic development. European countries with strong skiing traditions and integrated shooting programs have historically dominated. However, with athletes like Campbell Wright and Deedra Irwin, Team USA is closer than ever to breaking through.

### How far do biathletes shoot in the Olympics?

Biathletes shoot at targets positioned 50 meters (about 164 feet) away. In prone shooting, targets are 45mm in diameter. In standing shooting—which is more difficult due to body sway from exhaustion—targets are 115mm in diameter.

## The Bottom Line: Why You Should Be Watching Biathlon

Biathlon might be the most underrated spectacle at the Winter Olympics. It combines the raw endurance of cross-country skiing with the mental focus required to hit tiny targets while your heart is pounding from exertion. One missed shot can mean the difference between gold and no medal at all.

With France establishing early dominance, Italy energizing their home crowd, and Team USA hunting for their first-ever medal, the remaining biathlon events at Milano Cortina 2026 promise to deliver plenty more drama. Keep an eye on Campbell Wright in the individual events—if anyone can end America's 66-year drought, it's him.

The skiing-and-shooting saga continues in the Italian Alps, and biathlon fans worldwide are just getting started.
