Hilary Duff just broke the internet with the announcement that every millennial has been waiting for: **The Lucky Me World Tour 2026**. After more than two decades away from major touring, the beloved singer and actress is hitting the road for a massive global trek that spans four continents and includes legendary venues like Madison Square Garden and Red Rocks Amphitheatre.

For fans who grew up singing along to "Come Clean" and dreaming of what dreams are made of, this isn't just a concert tour—it's a full-circle moment that proves the 2000s pop princess is back and bigger than ever.

## Hilary Duff Announces Her First World Tour in Over 20 Years

On February 12, 2026, Duff revealed the news fans had been speculating about for days. She teased the announcement with an Instagram video featuring a clip from her 2004 film *A Cinderella Story*, where Jennifer Coolidge's character says, "Sweetheart, now that you're old enough, there's something I've always wanted to tell you, and I think you're ready to hear it." The date "2/12" flashed across the screen, sending fans into a frenzy.

The Lucky Me Tour kicks off **June 22, 2026, in West Palm Beach, Florida**, and will take Duff across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and Mexico before wrapping up on **February 12, 2027, in Mexico City**—exactly one year after the announcement.

This marks Duff's first major touring effort since her "Still Most Wanted" tour back in 2005. Yes, you read that right—it's been over 20 years since fans could catch Hilary Duff live in concert on a full-scale world tour.

## The Lucky Me Tour Supports Her Comeback Album

The tour coincides with the release of Duff's highly anticipated album **"Luck ...or Something"**, dropping February 20, 2026, via Atlantic Records. This is her first studio album in over a decade, following 2015's *Breathe In. Breathe Out.*

Duff's return to music began late last year with the release of her comeback single "Mature," followed by "Roommates." Both tracks showcase a more grown-up sound while maintaining the catchy pop sensibilities that made her a star in the early 2000s.

Earlier this year, she tested the waters with her "Small Rooms, Big Nerves Tour," an intimate run of shows where she performed "What Dreams Are Made Of" from *The Lizzie McGuire Movie* live for the **very first time**. The response was overwhelmingly emotional, with viral videos of fans crying and singing every word flooding social media.
