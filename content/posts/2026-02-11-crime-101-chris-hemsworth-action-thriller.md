Crime 101 is generating serious buzz ahead of its February 13 release, with early reactions hailing it as "the first great movie of the year." The heist thriller reunites Marvel stars Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo in their first collaboration outside the MCU, and critics can't stop comparing it to the golden age of 90s crime cinema.

If you've been craving a movie that feels like classic Michael Mann—think *Heat*, *Collateral*, or *Thief*—this might be exactly what you're looking for.

## What Is Crime 101 About?

At its core, Crime 101 follows a methodical thief played by Chris Hemsworth who teams up with a disillusioned insurance broker (Halle Berry) to pull off the score of a lifetime. Mark Ruffalo plays the LA detective determined to catch them before they disappear.

Director Bart Layton, known for the critically acclaimed *American Animals* and the documentary *The Imposter*, brings his unique visual sensibility to a story about middle-age reinvention and the desperate need to escape life's failures. This isn't your typical superhero-adjacent Hemsworth vehicle—it's a character-driven thriller that prioritizes tension over explosions.

## The MCU Reunion That Feels Completely Different

For fans who've watched Hemsworth and Ruffalo trade quips as Thor and Hulk across multiple Marvel films, Crime 101 represents a fascinating departure. In a recent interview with Radio Times, Ruffalo described being "taken aback" when Hemsworth arrived on set.

"He was a totally different person," Ruffalo said. "He walked differently, sounded different. Even his eye colour was different. I've always thought he's a great actor, and I want to see him explore a lot of different kinds of things."

Hemsworth acknowledged that the shift from Marvel's improvisational energy to Layton's more grounded approach was challenging. On *Thor: Ragnarok*, he and Ruffalo were "a couple of naughty kids just constantly talking and screwing around." But Crime 101 demanded something different.

"Bart was a bit more gentle about it but he had to be like, 'Guys, that's not the characters!'" Hemsworth laughed.

## Why Critics Are Calling It a 90s Throwback

Early reactions have been overwhelmingly positive, with reviewers praising Crime 101 as a love letter to the crime thrillers that defined a generation. Critic Scott Menzel called it "a crime thriller ripped straight out of the early 90s" and meant it as "the highest compliment."

Courtney Howard specifically namechecked Michael Mann's filmography, noting that the film echoes the character-driven tension of *Heat*, *Collateral*, and *Thief*. In an era dominated by CGI spectacles and franchise entries, Crime 101 proves that "engaging action thrillers don't need wall-to-wall visual effects to work."

The film runs 140 minutes—a runtime that some critics felt stretched a bit long—but most agree it builds to an "excellent final act" that justifies the slow burn.

## The Standout Performances You Need to Watch For

While Hemsworth and Ruffalo anchor the film, the supporting cast has earned particular praise:

**Barry Keoghan** plays what critics describe as a "dirtbag on a dirt bike" whose unpredictable energy electrifies every scene he's in. Multiple reviews noted that the movie "roars to life" whenever his unhinged character appears on screen.

**Halle Berry** delivers what one critic called an "all-timer monologue" that "earns our applause." As the insurance broker caught between her mundane life and the thrill of crime, Berry brings emotional weight to what could have been a purely functional role.

**Monica Barbaro**, fresh off her star-making turn in recent years, is described as "radiant" in her supporting role.

## Is Crime 101 Worth Watching?

Based on early reactions, Crime 101 appears to be the kind of adult-oriented, thoughtfully crafted thriller that Hollywood rarely makes anymore. It's not a superhero movie. It's not a remake or a sequel. It's an original story about flawed people making dangerous choices—the exact recipe that produced classics like *Heat* and *The Town*.

Critic Dustin Putman summarized it best: "Crime 101 is a top-notch crime thriller of brooding style, thoughtful moralistic inquiries, and lively character work, a delicious throwback to the kind of intelligent, adult-oriented studio fare Hollywood used to make."

Not every review was glowing—some found the film "takes far too long to become interesting" with "too many storylines that all feel pedestrian." But even skeptics praised the performances and the satisfying conclusion.
