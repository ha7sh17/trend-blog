# Fox's 'Best Medicine' Is Exactly What Broadcast TV Needed

There's a peculiar irony in the television industry right now. As streaming platforms chase spectacle and algorithms, a quirky little show about a grumpy doctor in coastal Maine is quietly becoming broadcast TV's biggest success story of 2026.

*Best Medicine*, Fox's American remake of the beloved British series *Doc Martin*, didn't just premiere strong—it's become the anchor of what Fox Corp. CEO Lachlan Murdoch is calling the network's "biggest midseason launch in 14 years." And in an era where traditional TV is supposedly dying, that's not just notable. It's remarkable.

## The Numbers That Matter

When *Best Medicine* premiered on January 4th following Fox's final NFL regular season game, it drew 3.69 million same-day viewers. Solid, but not earth-shattering by legacy standards. But here's where it gets interesting: across all platforms—streaming, DVR, on-demand—that number ballooned to **12 million viewers**.

More impressive than the raw totals is the retention. Subsequent episodes have averaged 3.3 million same-day viewers, retaining nearly **90 percent** of the premiere audience. In today's fragmented media landscape, where shows routinely shed half their audience by episode three, that kind of loyalty is gold.

*Best Medicine* wasn't alone in Fox's January surge. *Fear Factor: House of Fear*, the Johnny Knoxville-hosted revival of the 2000s reality staple, hit 11.6 million cross-platform viewers. *Memory of a Killer*, starring Patrick Dempsey, matched that number in just eight days after its NFC Championship post-game premiere.

Together, these three shows racked up 3.5 billion minutes of viewing time. Fox Entertainment programming as a whole logged 9.2 billion minutes in January—**21 percent higher than January 2025**.

## Why This Matters

The story here isn't just about ratings. It's about strategy, timing, and—dare I say—quality programming actually finding its audience.

Remember, Fox Corp. in 2026 looks nothing like the entertainment giant it was before 2019. When Disney absorbed 21st Century Fox, the "RemainCo" was explicitly centered on news and sports. Industry observers openly questioned whether Fox's broadcast network could—or would—maintain any meaningful entertainment presence.

The answer, it turns out, is yes. And the proof, as Murdoch told Wall Street analysts this week, "is in the pudding."

Entertainment revenue at Fox is up for the first time in four years. Four years of decline, suddenly reversed. And it's not happening through some flashy reboot or IP-driven franchise play. It's happening through shows like *Best Medicine*—adaptations of proven formats executed with care.

## The Doc Martin Formula

For those unfamiliar with the source material, *Doc Martin* ran for ten seasons on ITV in the UK, following the misadventures of a brilliant-but-socially-inept surgeon who develops a sudden fear of blood and relocates to a small Cornish village to become a general practitioner. It's fish-out-of-water comedy meets medical drama meets character study, anchored by Martin Clunes' wonderfully cantankerous performance.

The American version transplants the premise to coastal Maine, maintaining the core concept while adapting it for U.S. sensibilities. It's the kind of show that shouldn't work in theory—no explosions, no twist-a-minute plotting, no franchise potential—but resonates deeply in practice.

There's a hunger for this type of television. In an era of prestige TV anxiety and streaming burnout, sometimes people just want to watch a curmudgeonly doctor navigate small-town life and slowly, reluctantly, become a better person. It's comfort food, but the gourmet kind.

## The NFL Advantage

Let's not pretend Fox achieved this in a vacuum. All three midseason premieres benefited from post-NFL placement, one of the most valuable lead-ins in television. *Best Medicine* followed a regular season finale. *Fear Factor* launched after a wild card playoff game. *Memory of a Killer* got the coveted NFC Championship slot.

But here's the thing: plenty of shows have been handed post-NFL audiences and promptly squandered them. The lead-in gets people to sample; it doesn't guarantee they'll stay. *Best Medicine's* 90 percent retention rate isn't the NFL's doing. That's the show earning its audience, week after week.

## What Comes Next

Murdoch's comments on the earnings call suggest Fox isn't treating this as a fluke. The network has signed creative deals with Jamie Foxx, Taraji P. Henson, and former HBO executive Maria Zuckerman. They're pushing into creator content, inking deals with major YouTubers like Dhar Mann.

"We will always sign first-look deals and creative deals with the best content creators and producers and writers in the industry," Murdoch said. "That's something that we've always done, and will continue to do."

The strategy appears to be sustainable programming—balancing scripted and unscripted content while maintaining "an efficient and, ultimately, profitable cost base." It's not sexy, but in an industry bleeding money on streaming moonshots, profitable might be the most radical strategy of all.

## The Bigger Picture

There's been a lot of doom-and-gloom about broadcast television. And much of it is warranted—linear viewership continues its long decline, sports rights fees keep climbing, and the economics are genuinely challenging.

But *Best Medicine's* success points to something that gets lost in the narrative: there's still a massive audience that wants appointment television. People who want to sit down on Saturday night and watch something comforting with their family. People who aren't interested in scrolling through endless streaming catalogs or binge-watching entire seasons in a weekend.

Fox seems to have remembered that audience exists. And right now, they're being rewarded for it.

Will *Best Medicine* be remembered as the show that saved broadcast TV? Probably not. That's too dramatic, and the challenges facing the industry are too structural for any single show to solve.

But it might be remembered as the show that reminded everyone broadcast TV isn't dead yet. Sometimes, the best medicine is simply giving audiences what they actually want to watch.
