For weeks, the NFL world has been waiting for Jayden Daniels to say something—anything—about the Washington Commanders' decision to move on from offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury. On Thursday, during Super Bowl week in California, the 2024 Offensive Rookie of the Year finally broke his silence. And his answer was about as Jayden Daniels as it gets: honest, measured, and surprisingly optimistic.

"Man, it's tough, obviously. I trust what the organization is doing, and it was just tough," Daniels said on NBC's Pro Football Talk. "I have a relationship with him, and I wish him nothing but the best, but I'm also excited to get to work with Blough."

## The Breakup That Shocked Washington

Let's rewind to understand why this matters so much.

Just one year ago, Daniels and Kingsbury were the toast of the NFL. The 2024 season was nothing short of magical—Daniels threw for 3,568 yards and 25 touchdowns, rushed for 891 yards and another six scores, and led the Commanders to the NFC Championship Game for the first time since 1991. He wasn't just good; he was a revelation. A generational talent that made the entire franchise believe again.

Kingsbury was supposed to be the architect of this renaissance. The man who developed Patrick Mahomes at Texas Tech, tutored Kyler Murray in Arizona, and shaped Caleb Williams at USC had found his latest project in Daniels. Together, they seemed destined for greatness.

Then came 2025.

The Commanders stumbled to a brutal 5-12 record, including an agonizing eight-game losing streak that felt like it would never end. Daniels played in just seven games, sidelined by injuries that kept him watching from the sidelines while backups Marcus Mariota and Josh Johnson tried—and often failed—to keep the ship afloat. Terry McLaurin missed seven games. Noah Brown was out for 10 straight. The offense that had been fifth in scoring and seventh in total yards in 2024 plummeted to the league's bottom third.

When the season mercifully ended, Daniels made his feelings clear: "I love working with Kliff. Me and him have a special relationship. We have kind of built that over the past two years."

It didn't matter. On January 6th, Kingsbury and head coach Dan Quinn "mutually agreed" to part ways, with Kingsbury pursuing other opportunities—possibly head coaching positions with teams like the Raiders, Cardinals, Falcons, or Browns, all of whom cleaned house this offseason.

## Enter David Blough: The 30-Year-Old Prodigy

Here's where the story gets interesting.

Rather than hiring a proven play-caller from outside the organization, the Commanders promoted from within. Way within. David Blough, the 30-year-old assistant quarterbacks coach who had never called a play at any level, is now Washington's offensive coordinator.

On paper, it sounds insane. In practice? It might be genius.

Blough isn't your typical coaching hire. He was an NFL quarterback himself until 2023, bouncing around practice squads and briefly starting for the Detroit Lions. When he retired from playing, the Commanders brought him on as a coach—and he immediately clicked with Daniels.

How clicked? They play PIG together every Friday.

"It's on our fast Fridays, so we kinda have a certain window before we have to go to individuals," Daniels explained, grinning. "So, I think it's like 7 or 8 minutes, so PIG is probably the easiest, quickest way to figure out who is going to win and who is going to lose."

For those unfamiliar, PIG is essentially HORSE but shorter—a football throwing competition where you match shots or earn letters. It's the kind of thing that builds relationships. The kind of thing that creates trust.

"I always win," Daniels added. "Maybe one day, I'll let him win."

## Why the NFL Is Watching Closely

This isn't just a feel-good story about a quarterback and his buddy getting a chance. This is a fascinating football experiment that could reshape how teams think about coaching hires.

NFL Insider Ian Rapoport called the situation "fascinating" on the Commanders' official podcast: "Most people have thought that Blough would be an offensive coordinator or head coach since he was 22. He doesn't have the experience, but I am really interested in how this goes, because he's supposed to be excellent."

Blough has spent time learning from some of the league's brightest offensive minds. He was teammates with Ben Johnson in Detroit—the same Ben Johnson who just became head coach of the Chicago Bears after years as the Lions' mastermind offensive coordinator. He's absorbed concepts from Kevin O'Connell's Vikings offense. Now he gets to synthesize all of that and build something tailored specifically for Jayden Daniels.

The plan, according to reports, is to blend what Kingsbury did with elements of Johnson's Detroit offense—the same system that helped the Lions lead the league in scoring in recent years.

## The Defense Gets a Makeover Too

Washington didn't stop with just the offensive coordinator. Defensive coordinator Joe Whitt Jr. is also out after a dismal 2025 that saw the Commanders finish last in yards allowed per game.

His replacement? Daronte Jones, formerly the Vikings' defensive backs/pass game coordinator. Like Blough, he's never called plays at the NFL level. Like Blough, he's been around brilliant coaches—Lou Anarumo, Brian Flores. And like Blough, the Commanders are betting on potential over pedigree.

ProFootballTalk's Mike Florio described what Jones could bring: "Chaos and unpredictability. Certain guys will drop out into coverage and just confuse the offense. It just makes it easier to impose your will."

## What Happens Now

The Commanders are making a bet that not many teams would make. They're trusting two inexperienced coordinators with a franchise quarterback coming off an injury-plagued season. They're banking on relationships and potential rather than résumés and safe choices.

But here's the thing: Washington doesn't have time to play it safe. Daniels is on his rookie contract, which means the window to build around him affordably is shrinking. The 2024 NFC Championship run proved this team can compete when healthy. The 2025 disaster proved how quickly things can fall apart.

Now, with a full offseason to heal, a young quarterback motivated to prove last year was a fluke, and coaches who genuinely believe in each other, the Commanders are swinging for the fences.

"I've been with Blough for both of my years in the NFL," Daniels said. "So I'm most definitely excited about that."

Sometimes, the best path forward isn't finding someone new. It's recognizing what you already have. The Commanders are betting everything that David Blough is the answer they didn't know they were looking for.

And somewhere in Washington, on a future Friday afternoon, Jayden Daniels and his offensive coordinator will be throwing footballs at targets and talking about the next play design. Just two guys who trust each other, trying to figure out who wins PIG this week.

Smart money's still on Daniels.
