## Kiyan Anthony Gets First DNP of Freshman Season

In a move that sent shockwaves through the college basketball world, Syracuse coach Adrian Autry benched freshman guard Kiyan Anthony for the entire game against No. 18 Virginia on Saturday. The Orange fell 72-59, and Anthony—son of Syracuse legend and NBA Hall of Famer Carmelo Anthony—watched every second from the sideline.

It marked the first time all season that Kiyan Anthony didn't see a single minute of playing time, after appearing in all 23 previous games averaging 19.3 minutes per contest.

## Coach Autry Offers No Explanation Beyond "My Decision"

After the loss, coach Adrian Autry faced the inevitable questions about benching the program's most high-profile recruit. His response was direct but cryptic.

"No injury concerns. It was just my decision," Autry told reporters. "This is a physical team, an experienced team. It was just my decision. Nothing else."

When pressed further, Autry doubled down: "It's no narratives about any of this stuff. I just made the decision. That was just my decision that I made today."

Anthony had participated in pregame warmups and wasn't listed on the ACC's availability report, confirming this was purely a coaching decision—not an injury situation.

## Carmelo Anthony's Surprising Response to His Son's Benching

What might have been a flashpoint for drama instead became a moment of measured support. Under an ESPN Instagram post about his son's benching, Carmelo Anthony offered words of encouragement rather than criticism.

"He'll be good!" Carmelo wrote. "THEY SAY it's part of the journey. A little adversity don't hurt."

The response stood in contrast to earlier in the week, when Carmelo appeared to express frustration with the program. After Syracuse's 87-77 loss to No. 14 North Carolina on Monday—a game where Kiyan scored 10 points—the elder Anthony commented "SMFH" on the team's official Instagram post.

## The Weight of Legacy: Kiyan Anthony's Challenging Freshman Campaign

Being Carmelo Anthony's son at Syracuse comes with a mountain of expectations. Carmelo led the Orange to a national championship in 2003, defeating a favored Kansas squad as a freshman before becoming the third overall pick in the NBA Draft. His legacy looms large over the program.

Carmelo has put his money where his heart is. He spent millions to help build the school's men's and women's basketball practice facility, now named The Carmelo K. Anthony Basketball Center. He's not just a former player—he's a major booster with ongoing investment in the program's success.

Kiyan committed to Syracuse in 2024, hoping to carve out his own path while following in his father's footsteps. But the freshman season has been a rollercoaster of highs and lows.

## Kiyan Anthony's Statistics Tell the Story

The numbers paint a picture of a talented player still finding his footing at the college level:

- **Points per game:** 8.9
- **Field goal percentage:** 41.6%
- **Three-point percentage:** 23% (14-for-60)
- **Minutes per game:** 19.3

According to KenPom.com, Kiyan's offensive efficiency numbers are the lowest among Syracuse's rotation players—a stat that may have influenced Autry's decision against a physical Virginia team.

## Syracuse Basketball in Freefall

The benching comes at a brutal time for Syracuse basketball. The Orange have lost six of their last seven games, dropping to 13-11 overall and 4-7 in ACC play. They're stuck in the bottom half of conference standings with the season slipping away.

Coach Adrian Autry, himself one of the greatest guards in Syracuse basketball history, has faced increasing scrutiny as the losses mount. The decision to bench his highest-profile player against a ranked opponent suggests he's prioritizing winning over star power—or perhaps sending a message about accountability.

## What Experts Say Kiyan Anthony Needs to Succeed

Earlier this week, ESPN analysts offered perspective on what the 18-year-old needs to develop his NBA potential.

"He's a very talented player. This is not one of these situations where it's a superstar's kid," analyst Terrence Oglesby told the New York Post. "This is a kid who's got size, who has ability. He does still have a lot to learn, but everybody who's 18, 19 years old has a lot to learn."

Analyst Seth Greenberg emphasized patience: "He needs to be patient. Being a legacy is not easy because there's so much expectation. It's all in working on the right things and not letting anyone else run your race."

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How did Carmelo Anthony react to his son being benched?

## What's Next for Kiyan Anthony and Syracuse

Syracuse's next test comes Wednesday when they host California in another ACC matchup. Whether Kiyan Anthony returns to the rotation—and in what capacity—remains to be seen.

For now, both father and son seem aligned on one thing: this is part of the journey. Carmelo Anthony knows better than most that freshman seasons can be defining moments. He won a national championship in his only college season before turning pro.

Kiyan's path will be different. And as his father suggested, a little adversity might be exactly what he needs to grow into the player he's capable of becoming. The question is whether Syracuse's season can survive long enough for that growth to matter.

The pressure of legacy is real. The expectations are enormous. But at 18 years old, Kiyan Anthony has time—and apparently, a father who understands that the hardest lessons often teach the most.
