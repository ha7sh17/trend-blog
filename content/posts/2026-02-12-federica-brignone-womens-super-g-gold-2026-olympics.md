Federica Brignone just delivered one of the most emotional victories in Winter Olympics history. The Italian alpine skiing legend captured the women's Super-G gold medal at the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics today, crossing the finish line in 1:23.41 while her home crowd erupted in euphoria at Cortina d'Ampezzo.

But this wasn't just a story about one woman's triumph. The women's Super-G at the 2026 Olympics will be remembered as one of the most chaotic and unpredictable races ever held on the legendary Olimpia delle Tofane course.

## A Comeback Story for the Ages

What makes Brignone's gold medal even more remarkable is the journey she took to get here. Less than ten months ago, the 2025 overall World Cup champion suffered a devastating knee injury that many thought would end her career—or at least keep her out of her home Olympics.

"When I blew out my knee in April, I didn't know if I would ever race again," Brignone said, tears streaming down her face as Italian fans chanted her name. "To come back here, at home, and win gold... this is beyond my dreams."

Brignone, 35, is now the oldest woman to win an Olympic alpine skiing gold medal, proving that age is just a number when determination meets skill.

## Chaos on the Mountain: Why So Many Favorites Crashed

If you tuned in to watch the women's Super-G expecting a clean, predictable race, you were in for a shock. An incredible 16 skiers—nearly half the field—failed to finish the course, including several pre-race favorites.

The Olimpia delle Tofane course earned its fearsome reputation today. The Super-G, which Breezy Johnson famously described as "a hot mess... like going from an F1 car on a nice F1 track to a rally car in the woods," lived up to that chaotic description.

### High-Profile DNFs That Shocked the Skiing World

**Sofia Goggia (Italy)** – The downhill bronze medalist and season Super-G standings leader was skiing aggressively, carrying tremendous speed, when she missed a gate about midway through her run. The Italian crowd fell silent as their other medal hope saw her race end prematurely.

**Breezy Johnson (USA)** – The American star, who won downhill gold just four days earlier, clipped a gate about 20 seconds into her run after getting off her line on a jump. The collision spun her around and sent her into the safety netting. Thankfully, she was able to ski away.

**Ester Ledecka (Czech Republic)** – The 2018 Olympic Super-G champion was heartbreakingly close to the finish when she got off-balance on a jump landing and couldn't recover.

**Mary Bocock (USA)** – The American making her Olympic debut had a scary crash after catching too much air off a jump, landing sideways with her skis splayed in front of her. She was able to get back up, but her Olympic dream ended in disappointment.

## Women's Super-G Results: The Full Medal Standings

Here's how the podium shook out after the dust settled on the chaotic race:

🥇 **Federica Brignone (Italy)** – 1:23.41  
🥈 **Romane Miradoli (France)** – 1:23.82 (+0.41)  
🥉 **Cornelia Huetter (Austria)** – 1:23.93 (+0.52)

Ariane Raedler of Austria narrowly missed the podium, finishing just one-hundredth of a second behind Huetter. The margins at the top were razor-thin, while the gap between staying on course and crashing out proved equally narrow.

Other notable finishes included Laura Pirovano (Italy) in 6th, Alice Robinson (New Zealand) in 9th, and American Jackie Wiles in 13th.

## Why the Women's Super-G Is Alpine Skiing's Wildest Event

For casual viewers wondering why this race produced so much carnage, the Super-G occupies a unique middle ground in alpine skiing that makes it inherently unpredictable.

Unlike the downhill, where skiers get multiple training runs to learn every bump and turn, Super-G competitors only get one inspection of the course—on foot—before racing down it at speeds exceeding 60 mph. Unlike slalom or giant slalom, which have tighter turns that naturally control speed, Super-G allows racers to carry more momentum, but with more gates to navigate than a downhill.

The result? Athletes must make split-second decisions at incredible speeds on a course they've never actually skied before. One slight miscalculation—being a few inches off line, catching a bit too much air, leaning slightly wrong—can send an Olympic gold medal favorite tumbling into the safety nets.

## What This Win Means for Italian Alpine Skiing

Brignone's victory adds to an already stellar Milano Cortina 2026 for the Italian alpine skiing team. Racing on home snow at Cortina d'Ampezzo, a venue with deep historical significance in Italian skiing, the team has delivered performances that have captivated the host nation.

The win also cements Brignone's legacy as one of the greatest Italian alpine skiers of all time. She already held the record for most World Cup victories by an Italian woman; now she adds an Olympic gold medal in front of her home fans to her trophy case.

## How Team USA Fared in Women's Super-G

It was a tough day for the American women, with all four skiers failing to medal. Here's how Team USA finished:

- **Jackie Wiles** – 13th (1:25.40)
- **Keely Cashman** – 15th (1:25.61)
- **Breezy Johnson** – DNF (crash)
- **Mary Bocock** – DNF (crash)

Despite the disappointment, Johnson's downhill gold earlier in the Games ensures Team USA heads home with hardware from the alpine skiing events.

The challenging Olimpia delle Tofane course in Cortina d'Ampezzo featured tricky turns and jumps that caught many top competitors off guard. Nearly half the field (16 skiers) did not finish.

## Looking Ahead: What's Next at Milano Cortina 2026

The women's Super-G marked the final speed event on the alpine skiing calendar for the 2026 Winter Olympics. Attention now turns to the technical events, including giant slalom and slalom, where American star Mikaela Shiffrin will look to add to her Olympic medal collection.

For Federica Brignone, today's gold medal represents the culmination of an incredible comeback story and a dream fulfilled on home snow. At 35 years old, she's proven that champions are forged not just in the gym or on the slopes, but in the determination to come back from adversity.

As the Italian national anthem played and Brignone stood atop the podium, there wasn't a dry eye in Cortina d'Ampezzo. Some moments in sports transcend competition—and today, we witnessed one of them.
