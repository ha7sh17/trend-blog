The 2026 Winter Olympics ice dance competition in Milan has ignited a firestorm of controversy that's dominating headlines around the world. When France's Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron edged out American favorites Madison Chock and Evan Bates for the gold medal by just 1.43 points, it wasn't just an upset—it was a result that has fans, experts, and even fellow athletes questioning the very integrity of Olympic figure skating.

## What Happened in the Olympic Ice Dance Final

Wednesday night in Milan was supposed to be Madison Chock and Evan Bates' crowning moment. The three-time reigning world champions, competing in their fourth Olympic Games together, had led Team USA to gold in the team event just days earlier. They were the heavy favorites to finally capture that elusive individual Olympic gold medal.

And they delivered. Their matador-themed free dance to a flamenco rendition of "Paint It Black" was nothing short of spectacular. Chock embodied the matador while Bates played the bull, their perfectly synchronized choreography earning them a season-best score of 134.67 points in the free dance.

But it wasn't enough.

Fournier Beaudry and Cizeron, skating last with their emotional program set to music from "The Whale," scored 135.64 points to clinch gold with a total of 225.82 to America's 224.39.

## The Judging Controversy Explained

What's fueling the outrage isn't just the upset—it's how the scores were calculated. The numbers reveal a troubling pattern that's impossible to ignore.

In the free dance, five of nine judges actually scored Chock and Bates higher than the French pair. However, one judge's scores stood out dramatically: the French judge rated Cizeron and Beaudry a staggering **7.71 points higher** than the American duo. Meanwhile, no judge who favored Chock and Bates gave them more than a 4.1-point advantage.

This wasn't a one-time anomaly. In Monday's rhythm dance, the same French judge gave the French team a 5.74-point advantage over Chock and Bates—significantly wider than any other judge's margin. When the final tallies were calculated, these outlier scores proved decisive.

"It's a subjective sport. It's a judged sport," Bates said diplomatically after the event. "Sometimes you can feel like you do everything right and it doesn't go your way, and that's life and that's sport."

## The Controversial Background of the French Team

The judging controversy is only part of the story. The pairing of Fournier Beaudry and Cizeron itself has been marred in scandal since it was announced in March 2025.

Fournier Beaudry, who previously skated for Canada, only became available as a partner because her longtime teammate and romantic partner, **Nikolaj Sorensen, was suspended from the sport for six years** following allegations of sexual assault against an American figure skating coach. While the suspension was overturned on jurisdictional grounds in June, the case remains pending. Beaudry has publicly supported Sorensen throughout, and he was present in the arena Wednesday night—receiving jubilant waves from the gold medalists on the podium.

Cizeron, meanwhile, faces his own controversy. His former partner Gabriella Papadakis, with whom he won gold at the 2022 Beijing Olympics, released a memoir earlier this year accusing him of being "controlling, demanding, and critical." Papadakis described their skating relationship as "profoundly harmful and dangerous" and said she would not practice with him unless a coach was present.

Cizeron has dismissed these claims as a "smear campaign."

## Madison Chock and Evan Bates' Graceful Response

Despite the controversial circumstances, Chock and Bates have handled the situation with remarkable class—a testament to why they're considered ambassadors of the sport.

"It's definitely a little bittersweet because we are so, so happy with how we performed this week," Chock said through tears after the competition. "We really gave it our all, and I wouldn't change anything about how we approached each performance."

The 33-year-old Chock and 36-year-old Bates have been the backbone of American figure skating for over a decade. They served as team captains during the chaotic 2022 Beijing Olympics marked by the Russian doping scandal. They finally received their team gold medals at the 2024 Paris Olympics in a ceremony at the Eiffel Tower after the Kamila Valieva situation was resolved.

This week alone, they skated four demanding programs in six days—two in the team event and two in the individual competition—helping secure another team gold for the United States.

## What This Means for Figure Skating

USA Today's opinion columnist called the result "an awful message" to sexual abuse survivors and questioned what it says about the sport's values. The controversy has reignited long-standing debates about figure skating's judging system and whether reforms are needed.

The sport moved to a new scoring system after the 2002 Salt Lake City scandal, but critics argue that subjectivity and potential bias remain inherent issues. When a single judge's outlier scores can swing a competition this significant, questions about accountability become unavoidable.

Canadian pair Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier, who won bronze, diplomatically addressed the scoring debates that plagued the season: "We really let the judging be the judging and that's all we can do."

## Looking Forward

The 2026 Winter Olympics ice dance controversy will likely be debated for years to come. For Chock and Bates, they leave Milan with a silver medal that many believe should have been gold—and with the dignity and grace that has defined their legendary career.

As Chock reflected: "There's nothing more fulfilling than going out and performing your best and feeling like you have accomplished what you've trained for your entire career. To have that Olympic medal and that Olympic moment and feel like we had really done it—we felt that victory to our bones."

Whether the judging system will face scrutiny and reform remains to be seen. But one thing is certain: the Winter Olympics ice dance controversy of 2026 has exposed fault lines in the sport that can no longer be ignored.
