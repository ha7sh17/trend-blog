The NBA trade deadline has come and gone, and in one of the most surprising non-moves of the season, **Ja Morant** is still a Memphis Grizzly.

After weeks of speculation, phone calls, and what seemed like the beginning of a full roster teardown in Memphis, the two-time All-Star remains with the team that drafted him first overall back in 2019. But don't let the lack of a trade fool you—this wasn't about the Grizzlies changing their minds. It was about nobody else wanting to take the risk.

## The Ja Morant Trade Market Went Ice Cold

According to ESPN's Shams Charania, multiple teams were intrigued by Morant's undeniable talent. The 26-year-old point guard is one of the most electric players in the league when healthy, capable of taking over games with his explosive athleticism and highlight-reel finishes.

But here's the problem: "when healthy" has become the biggest asterisk attached to Morant's name.

Since the start of the 2023-24 season, Morant has played in just 79 games. This season alone, he's missed 20 of the team's 49 games due to a combination of suspensions and an extensive list of injuries. Currently, he's sidelined with an ulnar collateral ligament sprain in his left elbow, with the team announcing in late January that he'd be reevaluated in three weeks.

Teams simply weren't willing to pay full price for a star who can't stay on the court.

## Morant's Numbers Tell a Troubling Story

The statistical decline this season has been significant. Morant is averaging 19.5 points, 8.1 assists, and 3.3 rebounds per game—solid numbers for most players, but a step back for someone of his caliber.

More concerning are the efficiency metrics. His field goal percentage sits at a career-worst 41.0%, and his three-point shooting has cratered to just 23.5%. For a player with two years and $87 million left on his contract after this season, those numbers made front offices nervous.

When you combine the injury history with the declining production and off-court concerns from previous seasons, you get a trade market that's best described as "lukewarm."

## The Grizzlies Already Made Their Big Move

Two days before the deadline, Memphis sent shockwaves through the league by trading Jaren Jackson Jr., Jock Landale, John Konchar, and Vince Williams Jr. to the Utah Jazz. In return, the Grizzlies received three first-round picks along with Walter Clayton Jr., Kyle Anderson, Taylor Hendricks, and Georges Niang.

Perhaps most notably, the deal created a $28.8 million trade exception—the largest in NBA history, according to ESPN's Bobby Marks.

That trade felt like the first domino in what everyone assumed would be a complete teardown. Morant seemed like the obvious next piece to move. But when the deadline arrived, there were no takers at the price Memphis was asking.

## "I've Got a Logo on My Back"

For what it's worth, Morant himself has made his feelings clear. He wants to stay in Memphis.

"I've got a logo on my back, so that should tell you exactly where I want to be," Morant said last month, referring to his tattoo of the Grizzlies' logo. "If anybody in here knows me, I'm a very loyal guy."

It's a poetic statement, and one that resonates with the Memphis fanbase that has embraced Morant since day one. But loyalty alone doesn't win championships, and the Grizzlies find themselves in a peculiar position: stuck between a rebuild they've already started and a franchise player they can't seem to move.

## What Happens Next for Ja Morant and the Grizzlies?

The Grizzlies could explore potential trades again this summer when the market might look different. A healthy Morant playing well in the 2026-27 season could dramatically shift his value. Or, if the injury struggles continue, Memphis might have to accept a lower return than they'd hoped for.

For now, the team will focus on developing their young players while accumulating draft assets. The Jaren Jackson Jr. trade suggests they're thinking long-term, even if Morant's situation remains unresolved.

The reality is that the Ja Morant era in Memphis, as we knew it, is likely over. The team that pushed the Golden State Warriors to the brink in 2022 and earned the second seed in the Western Conference feels like a distant memory. What comes next is uncertain, but the blueprint has shifted from "build around Ja" to "prepare for whatever comes after."

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Was Ja Morant actually traded at the 2026 deadline?

No, Ja Morant was not traded. Despite the Memphis Grizzlies fielding calls about the two-time All-Star, no team made a serious enough offer to complete a deal. Morant remains with the Grizzlies for now.

### Why didn't teams want to trade for Ja Morant?

The main concerns were his availability and recent performance. Morant has played just 79 games since the 2023-24 season and is currently dealing with an elbow injury. His shooting percentages this year are at career lows, and he still has $87 million remaining on his contract.

### What did the Grizzlies get for Jaren Jackson Jr.?

Memphis traded Jaren Jackson Jr., Jock Landale, John Konchar, and Vince Williams Jr. to Utah for three first-round picks, Walter Clayton Jr., Kyle Anderson, Taylor Hendricks, and Georges Niang. The trade also created a record $28.8 million trade exception.

## The Bottom Line

The 2026 NBA trade deadline will be remembered for what happened in Memphis—and what didn't. The Grizzlies tore down much of the roster that made them a contender, but their most famous player remains. 

Ja Morant staying in Memphis wasn't a vote of confidence; it was a market reality. When healthy and engaged, he's one of the most exciting players in basketball. But the NBA is a business built on availability, and right now, Morant represents too much risk for other teams to justify the cost.

The summer will bring new opportunities and possibly new suitors. Until then, Morant will work to get healthy, and Memphis will continue building toward an uncertain future—one that may or may not include its most dynamic player.
