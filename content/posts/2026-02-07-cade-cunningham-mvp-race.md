Cade Cunningham is making the NBA world pay attention. The Detroit Pistons point guard just vaulted into the top five of the Kia MVP Ladder, and with the league's leading assist numbers and a team that's turned from basement dweller to championship contender, the question isn't whether Cunningham belongs in the MVP conversation—it's whether he can actually win it.

## Cade Cunningham's Breakout Season by the Numbers

The stats tell a compelling story. Cunningham is averaging 25.4 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 9.8 assists per game—that last number leading the entire NBA. He's not just passing the ball effectively; he's orchestrating one of the most balanced offenses in basketball while shouldering the scoring load himself.

What makes these numbers even more impressive is the context. Just two seasons ago, the Detroit Pistons finished with a league-worst 14-68 record. Now? They're 36-12 and breathing down the neck of the Oklahoma City Thunder for the best record in basketball.

This kind of franchise turnaround doesn't happen without a transcendent player at the helm. Cunningham isn't just good—he's become the engine that makes Detroit run.

## Steve Kerr Compares Cunningham to NBA Legends

When Steve Kerr speaks about basketball talent, people listen. The Warriors coach has won championships as both a player (with Michael Jordan and Tim Duncan) and a coach (with Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant). His opinion carries weight.

After Cunningham torched Golden State for 29 points and 11 assists in a 131-124 Pistons victory, Kerr didn't hold back:

> "He's awesome. He reminds me of Luka and James Harden. Just kind of a one-man offense, running everything through him. He's a great, great player, really coming into his own."

Being compared to Luka Dončić—the current scoring leader averaging 32.8 points per game—and James Harden—the last American-born player to win MVP—is rarefied air. Kerr has seen the best of the best. He's not throwing those names around lightly.

## Draymond Green Makes the MVP Case

Draymond Green, never one to mince words, went even further on his podcast. The Warriors forward, who just experienced Cunningham's brilliance firsthand, made an emphatic argument:

> "The reality is, we have an MVP candidate, an American-born MVP candidate in Cade Cunningham, that does not get the notoriety, does not get the publicity of being an MVP candidate. There's no chance Cade Cunningham is not a top 3 MVP candidate in the NBA today."

Green raised a point that's become a talking point in NBA circles: the last American-born player to win MVP was James Harden back in 2019. Since then, it's been a parade of international talent—Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokić, and now Shai Gilgeous-Alexander sits atop the current ladder.

Cunningham represents America's best chance to break that streak.

## The Pistons' Remarkable Transformation

Context matters in MVP voting, and Cunningham has it in spades. Detroit's turnaround from 14 wins to potential 50-plus wins is the kind of narrative that captivates voters.

The Pistons aren't winning through defensive grind-outs or heroball. They're a balanced, well-coached team with depth at every position. But every system needs a conductor, and Cunningham has been masterful at reading defenses, creating opportunities for teammates, and taking over games when necessary.

His recent performances underscore the point:
- **29 points, 10 assists** against Nikola Jokić and the Denver Nuggets
- **29 points, 11 assists** against Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors
- **26 double-doubles** on the season, showcasing consistency

When you're outplaying multiple MVP candidates in head-to-head matchups, your resume starts looking awfully impressive.

## Where Cunningham Stands in the MVP Race

As of this week's Kia MVP Ladder, here's how the top five shakes out:

1. **Shai Gilgeous-Alexander** (OKC) – 31.8 ppg, 6.4 apg
2. **Luka Dončić** (LAL) – 32.8 ppg, 8.6 apg
3. **Nikola Jokić** (DEN) – 29.1 ppg, 10.5 apg
4. **Cade Cunningham** (DET) – 25.4 ppg, 9.8 apg
5. **Victor Wembanyama** (SAS) – 24.2 ppg, 11.1 rpg

The door may be opening even wider. Gilgeous-Alexander is currently sidelined with an abdominal strain and will be re-evaluated after the All-Star break. If the Thunder stumble without their star while the Pistons continue rolling, Cunningham's case only strengthens.

At just 24 years old, Cunningham is hitting his stride at the perfect time. The All-Star break approaches, and he'll take the court as a starter—the top vote-getter among Eastern Conference guards.
