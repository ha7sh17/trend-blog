Julia Simon stood on top of the Olympic podium Wednesday, tears streaming down her face as the French national anthem played. But this wasn't your typical feel-good Olympic moment. Just four months earlier, Simon had been convicted of stealing credit card information from the teammate she had just beaten to gold.

The 29-year-old French biathlete's victory in the women's 15km individual event at the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics has reignited one of the most controversial stories in winter sports. Her victim, Justine Braisaz-Bouchet? She finished 80th in the same race.

## The Julia Simon Credit Card Fraud Case Explained

The scandal first came to light in 2023, though the crimes occurred between 2021 and 2022. French authorities discovered that Simon had used credit card details belonging to teammate Braisaz-Bouchet to make online purchases totaling more than €2,000 (roughly $2,300). She had also stolen and used the card information of the team's physiotherapist.

For three years, Simon denied everything. She claimed she was a victim of identity theft, maintaining her innocence even as evidence mounted against her. The facade crumbled in October 2025 when investigators found photos of Braisaz-Bouchet's credit card stored on Simon's phone.

"I confess the accusations but I don't remember committing them," Simon told the court in Albertville last October. "It's like a blackout."

The French court handed down a €15,000 fine and a three-month suspended prison sentence. Simon said she found her own actions "incomprehensible" and was working with a psychologist to understand what happened.

## How Julia Simon Was Still Allowed to Compete at the Olympics

Many fans were shocked to see Simon competing in Milano Cortina at all. The French Ski Federation imposed a six-month ban, but here's the catch — five of those months were suspended. In practical terms, Simon missed just one early-season World Cup event before returning to full competition.

The light punishment sparked outrage in the biathlon community. Critics argued that a crime against a teammate should have resulted in Olympic disqualification. Supporters countered that Simon had served her legal penalty and deserved a second chance.

The federation's decision allowed Simon to compete at the Olympics, where she first helped France win gold in the 4x6km mixed relay on Sunday before capturing individual gold on Wednesday.

## Justine Braisaz-Bouchet: The Forgotten Victim

While Simon has been winning medals, the story of her victim has largely been overlooked. Braisaz-Bouchet, also 29, found herself subjected to vicious online harassment after the scandal became public.

"It has made a lot of people angry," Braisaz-Bouchet said. "The story came out in 2023, after Julia Simon's great season, and for many people I was the troublemaker."

Let that sink in. The victim of credit card fraud was treated as the villain because her attacker was winning races. Braisaz-Bouchet's 80th-place finish in the 15km event Wednesday felt like a cruel footnote to an already painful chapter.

## Julia Simon's Cryptic Celebration Adds More Drama

As Simon crossed the finish line to claim gold, she held a finger to her lips in a silencing gesture. When pressed about its meaning, she was deliberately vague.

"I put my finger to my mouth, it was for one person and they know who because we had a talk," Simon said. "But I won't tell any more about it, it's over."

She later admitted the gesture was a response to "a bad article" she had seen the night before, adding: "I'm here for sports. I'm doing my best sport. So now we have to speak about sport and not about gossip. If you want to speak about gossip, you go away."

Simon has repeatedly asked to be left alone and insisted the "page has been turned" within the team.

## French Biathlon's Larger Ethics Problem

The Julia Simon scandal is just one of several controversies plaguing French biathlon in recent years. Lou Jeanmonnot, who won silver behind Simon on Wednesday, revealed last year that she had received death threats from a gambler angry about betting losses linked to her performances.

Another French team member, Jeanne Richard, was briefly excluded from the national squad after accusations of tampering with a teammate's gun. The sport's international governing body is also still recovering from the resignation of longtime president Anders Besseberg, who was sentenced to three years in prison for accepting bribes including watches, hunting trips, a BMW, and sex workers in exchange for protecting Russian interests during the state-sponsored doping scandal.

## What Julia Simon's Gold Medal Means for the Sport

Simon now has two gold medals from Milano Cortina 2026 and 10 world championship titles to her name. By any athletic measure, she is one of the greatest biathletes of her generation. But her legacy will forever carry an asterisk.

The conversation around Simon's victories raises uncomfortable questions about redemption, punishment, and whether athletic excellence can coexist with personal failings. Some argue that sports and personal conduct should be judged separately. Others believe representing your country at the Olympics is a privilege that should require higher ethical standards.

What's clear is that Simon's talent is undeniable. Her performance on the shooting range Wednesday — missing only once across four stages — was among the best of the day. But every time she stands on a podium, the shadow of what she did to her teammate follows her there.

The French Ski Federation imposed a six-month ban on Simon, but five months were suspended.

## The Verdict: Athletic Greatness, Moral Complexity

Julia Simon's Olympic triumph is a story without easy heroes or villains. She is a supremely talented athlete who committed a serious breach of trust against her own teammate, served a minimal punishment, and went on to achieve the ultimate prize in her sport.

Whether you view her gold medal as an inspiring comeback or a troubling failure of accountability probably says something about how you view sports, justice, and second chances. What's certain is that this story isn't going away anytime soon — and neither are the complicated feelings it evokes every time Julia Simon steps onto a podium.

The 2026 Winter Olympics continue in Milano Cortina, but this scandal has already become one of the defining narratives of the Games.
