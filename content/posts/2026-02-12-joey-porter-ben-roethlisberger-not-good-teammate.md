Joey Porter just dropped a bombshell on the Pittsburgh Steelers' legacy, calling out Ben Roethlisberger as "not a good teammate" and "not a good person" in an explosive podcast interview that's sending shockwaves through the NFL community. The former Pro Bowl linebacker didn't hold back, revealing years of locker room frustrations that were apparently kept quiet to protect the franchise quarterback.

## Joey Porter Breaks His Silence on Ben Roethlisberger

Speaking on Cameron Heyward's podcast "Not Just Football" during Super Bowl week, Porter unloaded on his former teammate with remarkable candor. The two-time Super Bowl champion linebacker, who played alongside Roethlisberger from 2004-2006, revealed what many in the Steelers organization apparently knew but never said publicly.

"Won the Super Bowl with him, but the person, he's just not a good teammate," Porter stated. "He knows that. Anybody in the Steelers building knows that, but we protected him because I've only won one Super Bowl and that was my quarterback. So do I love my quarterback? Yeah, but is he a good person? No."

The comments come after Roethlisberger's recent criticism of former head coach Mike Tomlin on his own podcast, "Footbahlin With Ben Roethlisberger." Porter made it clear that Big Ben crossed a line by airing team business publicly.

## What Sparked Porter's Explosive Comments About Roethlisberger

Porter's frustration with Roethlisberger stems from specific incidents during the quarterback's rookie season that set the tone for their relationship. According to Porter, who was a team captain at the time, Roethlisberger refused to sign memorabilia for teammates' families—a common courtesy in NFL locker rooms.

"He was telling people, 'No, I'm not going to sign that,'" Porter recalled. "Once he did that, who they come and tell? The captain. When he first did it to Chris Hoke, I was like, 'Damn, that's messed up, man.' I grabbed it from Hoke, took it over there and told him to sign it."

But the situation escalated when Roethlisberger refused a similar request from veteran defensive end Aaron Smith.

"Then when he did that to Aaron Smith, now I got to have a meeting," Porter said. "You're a rookie. You're a young guy. You can't tell my vets you're too cool to sign for my vets. Who the hell is too cool to sign for your teammate? I'm not a fan."

## Ben Roethlisberger Never Earned His Captain Title, Porter Claims

Perhaps the most damaging allegation Porter made was that Roethlisberger never earned his captain designation through a locker room vote—the traditional method used during Porter's era with the team.

"We voted to be captains. You had to be voted in," Porter explained. "He came in the era where they just gave you the 'C'—because if he wasn't a captain, he'd probably have a hissy fit. But nobody's going to vote for him as captain because he don't have no captain qualities."

Porter contrasted this with the leadership he witnessed from other Steelers legends: "Look at the team when Joey was a captain. When Jerome [Bettis] was a captain. When Hines Ward was a captain. You heard nothing in the locker room. Captains have to do captain stuff."

## Big Ben "Broke the Brotherhood" With Podcast Criticism

Porter accused both Roethlisberger and James Harrison of violating an unwritten code among former players by criticizing team business on their respective podcasts. Harrison has been particularly vocal in his criticism of Tomlin since the coach's resignation in January, even suggesting Tomlin doesn't deserve Hall of Fame consideration.

"Seven definitely broke the brotherhood," Porter said, referring to Roethlisberger's jersey number. "Out of anybody that should talk, he should never grab a microphone and really talk Steeler business. Because if we talk Steelers business, his ass is foul of all foul. The shit that he did is foul of all foul."

The linebacker seemed to reference not just the autograph incidents but darker chapters in Roethlisberger's history. Big Ben was famously suspended four games in 2010 for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy amid allegations from women over misconduct in 2008 and 2010.

## Current Steelers Players React to Porter-Roethlisberger Drama

The fallout from Porter's comments has already begun rippling through Steelers circles. Backup quarterback Mason Rudolph, whose frosty relationship with Roethlisberger was well-documented during their time together in Pittsburgh, appeared to support Porter's assessment on social media.

Rudolph's apparent endorsement adds another layer to a story that's pulling back the curtain on years of tension within the Steelers organization. While Roethlisberger developed close relationships with some teammates—notably tight end Heath Miller and center Maurkice Pouncey—Porter's comments suggest those friendships were the exception rather than the rule.

## What This Means for Roethlisberger's Legacy

Despite Porter's harsh words, Roethlisberger's on-field accomplishments remain undeniable. He's a two-time Super Bowl champion, a six-time Pro Bowler, and ranks among the top passers in NFL history. He, Porter, and Maurkice Pouncey were all inducted into the Steelers Hall of Honor just this past December.

But Porter's comments raise uncomfortable questions about how much winning should excuse poor behavior in the locker room. The revelation that the team collectively "protected" Roethlisberger despite his conduct suggests a culture where success trumped accountability.

Roethlisberger's representatives did not respond to ESPN's request for comment on Porter's allegations. The quarterback himself has previously acknowledged that he wasn't always the best teammate, though he's never gone into detail about specific incidents.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is Joey Porter criticizing Ben Roethlisberger now?

Porter's comments came in response to Roethlisberger and James Harrison criticizing former coach Mike Tomlin on their podcasts after Tomlin's resignation. Porter felt they were violating the "brotherhood" by publicly discussing team business, especially given their own histories with the organization.

### Were Ben Roethlisberger and Joey Porter teammates?

Yes, Porter and Roethlisberger were teammates for three seasons (2004-2006) and won Super Bowl XL together. Porter later returned to the Steelers as a defensive coach from 2015-2018, overlapping with the latter part of Roethlisberger's career.

### Has Ben Roethlisberger responded to Joey Porter's comments?

As of now, Roethlisberger and his representatives have not publicly responded to Porter's allegations. Roethlisberger has previously acknowledged he wasn't always the best teammate, but has never detailed specific incidents.

## The Bigger Picture: Steelers Culture Under the Microscope

Porter's willingness to speak out suggests a shifting dynamic among former Steelers players. With Tomlin now gone after 18 seasons, the protective shield that once surrounded team business appears to be crumbling.

The story also highlights the tension between loyalty and honesty in professional sports. Porter clearly loved winning with Roethlisberger and remained loyal to his quarterback throughout their playing days. But watching Roethlisberger criticize Tomlin—a coach Porter deeply respects—was apparently the final straw.

"What makes it crazy for me to watch them two talk like that and really act like we don't have the real receipts of how this really works," Porter said. "When they tell their stories, you'll think Mike didn't do shit for them. I don't know how to shit on somebody that looked out for me."

As the NFL moves into the offseason, the Roethlisberger-Porter controversy is a reminder that some of the biggest stories in football happen long after the final whistle blows. And sometimes, the truth takes years to finally come out.
