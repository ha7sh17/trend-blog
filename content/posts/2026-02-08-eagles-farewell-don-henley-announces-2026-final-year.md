After 55 years of defining American rock music, the Eagles are taking their final bow. In a candid interview with CBS Sunday Morning, Don Henley — the band's sole surviving founding member — confirmed that 2026 will "probably be it" for one of the best-selling bands in history.

For fans who grew up singing along to "Hotel California" and "Take It Easy," the news hits hard. But Henley, now 78, sounds genuinely at peace with the decision.

## Don Henley's Emotional Announcement on CBS Sunday Morning

The revelation came during an intimate conversation with correspondent Tracy Smith, set to air on Super Bowl Sunday. When asked directly if 2026 would mark the end of the Eagles, Henley didn't hesitate.

"I think so, yeah. And I am OK with that."

It's a stark departure from the band's previous flirtations with retirement. The Eagles famously split in 1980, only to reunite 14 years later for what was billed as a "Hell Freezes Over" tour. That supposed one-off comeback stretched into three more decades of performing.

But this time feels different. Henley isn't just talking about stepping back — he's talking about stepping into a different life entirely.

## Why the Eagles Are Ending Their Run in 2026

When pressed on his reasons, Henley's answer was surprisingly simple and human.

"Because I would like to spend more time with my family," he said. "And I would like to spend more time growing vegetables."

It's the kind of answer that catches you off guard. Here's a rock legend who's performed for millions, and his retirement dream involves a vegetable garden. But there's more depth to it.

Henley explained that decades of touring have left him with a paradox: he's traveled the world but hasn't really seen it.

"We see the airports and the hotel room and the venue, and we don't get out much. I'd like to go back to the places I've been and see more of those places before it all disappears."

With four children and a grandchild waiting for more of his time, Henley's priorities have clearly shifted. "I don't ever want to have a one-dimensional life," he reflected. "This is great, this is wonderful, but there are other things."

## The Eagles' Final Concert Schedule: Last Chances to See Them Live

If you've been waiting for the right moment to catch the Eagles live, that moment is now. The band has a limited run of shows left before they hang up their guitars for good.

**Remaining Sphere Las Vegas Dates:**
- February 20-21, 2026
- February 27-28, 2026
- March 20-21, 2026
- March 27-28, 2026

**Final Scheduled Performance:**
- May 2, 2026 — New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival

The Sphere residency has been nothing short of spectacular. By the time they wrap up their March dates, the Eagles will have performed 56 shows at the iconic Las Vegas venue since their residency began in 2024.

These final shows are selling out fast. If you want to witness rock history one last time, tickets are available through the [official Eagles website](https://eagles.com/pages/tour).

## A Legacy That Changed American Music Forever

The numbers alone tell an incredible story. The Eagles have sold more than 150 million albums worldwide, making them one of the best-selling American bands of all time.

But here's the statistic that truly puts their impact in perspective: "Their Greatest Hits (1971-1975)" recently surpassed 40 million units in sales and streams, cementing its position as the best-selling album in United States history. Not the best-selling rock album — the best-selling album, period.

The band's trophy case includes six Grammy Awards and six number-one albums. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998, and their influence on country rock, soft rock, and American popular music is immeasurable.

Songs like "Hotel California," "Desperado," "Life in the Fast Lane," and "One of These Nights" didn't just top charts — they became the soundtrack of American life.

## The End of an Era: Honoring Glenn Frey's Memory

Part of what makes this goodbye feel so final is the weight of loss the band has already endured. Glenn Frey, who co-founded the Eagles with Henley in 1971, passed away in January 2016.

Frey's death marked a turning point. The Eagles continued, with Vince Gill stepping in to help carry the torch, but the band was never quite the same. Henley has been the last original member standing, carrying forward a legacy that began when he and Frey were young musicians chasing a dream in Los Angeles.

Now, with Henley ready to move on, the Eagles' story will finally reach its conclusion — not with a dramatic breakup, but with a graceful exit.

## Don Henley's Life Beyond the Eagles

For those wondering what comes next for Henley, his CBS interview offered some clues. Beyond family time and gardening, he chairs two environmental organizations that have been close to his heart for decades.

The Walden Woods Project, which he founded in 1990, works to protect the historic site where Henry David Thoreau wrote his famous works in Massachusetts. The Caddo Lake Institute focuses on preserving wetlands in Henley's home state of Texas.

These causes reflect a side of Henley that casual fans might not know — a thoughtful environmentalist who sees his post-Eagles life as an opportunity to make a different kind of impact.

## The Final Encore: A Farewell Fans Won't Forget

Rock bands don't always get to choose their ending. Some fade away, others implode in spectacular fashion. But the Eagles, true to form, are doing it their way.

Don Henley's announcement isn't just about a band retiring — it's about a man who's spent more than half a century making music deciding that there's still more to life. He wants to watch his vegetables grow, spoil his grandchild, and finally explore the cities he's only ever seen from hotel windows.

For fans, the Eagles' farewell represents the end of something irreplaceable. But if the CBS interview proved anything, it's that Henley is leaving on his own terms, with gratitude rather than regret.

"This is great, this is wonderful," he said of his career. "But there are other things."

If you can make it to Vegas or New Orleans in the coming months, do it. The Eagles won't be taking it easy much longer.
