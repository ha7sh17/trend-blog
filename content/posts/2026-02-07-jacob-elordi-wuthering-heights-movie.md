Jacob Elordi is making headlines again—but this time, it's not for his brooding good looks or his Euphoria fame. The Australian actor has stepped into the role of Heathcliff in Emerald Fennell's highly anticipated *Wuthering Heights* adaptation, and the internet absolutely cannot stop talking about it.

## Jacob Elordi's Casting as Heathcliff Sparks Intense Debate

When news first broke that Jacob Elordi would play the iconic literary anti-hero Heathcliff opposite Margot Robbie's Catherine Earnshaw, the reactions were... mixed, to put it mildly.

The controversy began almost immediately. In Emily Brontë's original novel, Heathcliff is described as a "dark-skinned gipsy," leading many scholars to argue the character isn't white—and that his "otherness" is central to understanding why he's mistreated and ostracized in the story. So when the very white, very conventionally handsome Elordi was cast, some fans felt the production had missed a crucial point.

"There was one Instagram comment that said the casting director should be shot," recalled Kharmel Cochrane, the film's casting director. But she wasn't fazed. "You really don't need to be accurate. It's just a book. That is not based on real life. It's all art."

That's a bold stance—and it's exactly the kind of energy director Emerald Fennell brings to everything she touches.

## Emerald Fennell's Vision: Definitely Not Your Grandmother's Wuthering Heights

If you've seen *Saltburn* or *Promising Young Woman*, you already know Fennell doesn't do subtle. Her version of *Wuthering Heights* is shaping up to be equally provocative—steamy trailers featuring "suggestive breadmaking," Charli XCX on the soundtrack, and costumes that look more 1980s than 1800s.

The August 2025 test screenings reportedly left audiences polarized. According to World of Reel, attendees felt the story was "stripped of emotional nuance and full of salacious detours that serve shock value."

But here's the thing: the early critical reactions tell a completely different story.

Film critic Courtney Howard called it "intoxicating, transcendent, tantalising, bewitching, lust worthy, hypnotic" and a "god-tier new classic." Anne Thompson praised it as a "rip-roaring, bodice-ripping crowd-pleaser," noting that "audiences will fall for Emerald Fennell's garish visuals and unrestrained direction. Everything is BIG."

## Why the Backlash Against Wuthering Heights Started So Early

The hostility toward this adaptation didn't come out of nowhere. It's been building since July 2024, when Fennell was first announced as the director.

Fennell has become something of a lightning rod in Hollywood. Yes, she won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for *Promising Young Woman* in 2021. Yes, *Saltburn* was a massive cultural phenomenon. But both films also faced significant backlash—accusations of prioritizing style over substance, dealing in cheap twists, and creating pop-hit-soundtracked memes rather than meaningful art.

Then there's the class issue. Fennell comes from serious privilege—her 18th birthday party was photographed by Tatler and attended by Delevingnes, Guinness heirs, and the daughter of Sting. When she played Camilla Parker-Bowles in *The Crown*, she didn't have to change her accent at all.

For some critics, this background makes her the wrong person to adapt a story about a working-class outsider like Heathcliff. For others, it's exactly why she'll bring a unique perspective to the material.

## Book Sales Skyrocket 469% Thanks to the Film

Here's something everyone can agree on: people are reading *Wuthering Heights* again.

According to Penguin Classics UK, sales of Brontë's novel have risen by an astonishing 469% compared to last year. In January 2026 alone, 10,670 copies sold in the UK—compared to just 1,875 in January 2025.

"I can't remember the last time a film adaptation generated this much excitement for the book," said Jess Harrison, publishing director for Penguin Classics. "There seems to be a real yearning among readers for intense, maximalist, tragic love stories."

The spike actually began last September, when the first teaser trailer dropped. Between then and year's end, Penguin sold 28,257 copies in the UK—more than double the 12,134 sold during the same period in 2024.

It seems controversy is good for book sales.

## The Age Gap Issue Nobody Wants to Talk About

Beyond the racial casting debate, there's another elephant in the room: the actors' ages.

In Brontë's novel, Cathy and Heathcliff are teenagers during their intense romance. Margot Robbie is 35. Jacob Elordi is 28. Neither is anywhere close to the age of the characters they're playing.

Defenders point out this isn't new—Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon were 32 and 28 in the classic 1939 adaptation. But times have changed. Audiences are more sensitive to authenticity and age-appropriate casting than they were 87 years ago.

And for those keeping score: Andrea Arnold's 2011 *Wuthering Heights* cast James Howson, a Black actor, as Heathcliff, while Kaya Scodelario was just 19 when it released. To some, Fennell's casting feels like a step backward—straight back to 1939.

## What Critics Are Actually Saying

With the UK premiere set for February 13, reviews are technically still under embargo. But the early social media reactions from those who've seen advance screenings have been overwhelmingly positive.

The film is being described as "hot," "horny," and everything Fennell fans would expect. Whether that's a compliment or criticism depends entirely on your perspective.

One thing's certain: nobody is calling it boring.
