## Sophia Kirkby Is Looking for Love at the Winter Olympics — And the Internet Can't Get Enough

Forget about gold medals for a moment. The biggest story coming out of the 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics right now isn't a world record or a podium finish — it's a 24-year-old American luge athlete who just announced she's single and ready to mingle in the Olympic Village.

**Sophia Kirkby**, a three-time World Championship medalist in women's doubles luge, has gone viral after posting Bachelorette-style videos on social media declaring that she's actively looking for romance during the Games. And yes, she says fans are welcome to apply too.

"I'm single at the moment," Kirkby told reporters with refreshing honesty. "I thought it would be interesting for people to watch the athlete's dating life during the Olympics. I'm really excited to enter the Olympic Village."

## Who Is Sophia Kirkby? The Viral Olympic Sensation Explained

Sophia Kirkby isn't your typical Olympic athlete — and that's exactly what makes her so compelling to watch.

Born and raised around Lake Placid, New York, Kirkby's sliding sports journey began at just eight years old when her father James introduced her to the track. James himself was a bobsledder for the United States Air Force back in the 1970s, and his only daughter inherited his passion for speed.

Now, at 24, Kirkby is competing in her first Olympic Games alongside partner Chevonne Forgan in the **historic Olympic debut of women's doubles luge**. That's right — this event has never been contested at an Olympics before, making Kirkby and every other doubles luger this week Olympic pioneers.

But it's her off-track declaration that's captured the world's attention.

## The Viral Dating Announcement That Broke the Internet

In the days leading up to the Games, Kirkby took to social media with a series of videos that can only be described as "The Bachelorette: Olympic Village Edition."

She's been updating her 10,000+ followers about her love life status, declaring herself the "best bride of this tournament," and making it crystal clear that she's not just focused on the podium.

"If I can't find a mate among the players, I'm also very open to dating fans," Kirkby revealed — a statement that immediately sent shockwaves across the internet.

With Valentine's Day falling during this year's Winter Olympics (February 14th is right in the middle of the competition schedule), the timing couldn't be more perfect for Kirkby's romantic quest.

## Why Sophia Kirkby's Olympic Romance Quest Is Going Viral

Let's be honest: Olympic athletes dating each other isn't exactly breaking news. The Games have always been famous for romance blooming in the Village — after all, the organizing committee distributes **thousands of free condoms** to athletes every Olympics.

But Kirkby's refreshingly honest, playful approach to the whole thing is what sets her apart:

- **She's transparent about her intentions** — no pretense, no hiding
- **She's including fans in the equation** — breaking down the athlete/spectator barrier
- **She's making it content** — documenting the journey for followers in real time
- **The timing is perfect** — Valentine's Day during the Olympics creates natural drama

Her approach has drawn comparisons to British cycling power couple Laura and Jason Kenny, who famously caught the world's attention with a kiss from the stands during the 2012 London Olympics. They eventually got married.

Could Kirkby find her own Olympic love story? The internet is watching.

## The Heartfelt Story Behind the Viral Personality

But there's a deeper layer to Sophia Kirkby's story that makes her even more compelling.

Behind the viral videos and playful dating updates is an athlete processing profound grief. Her father James passed away last summer after battling Stage 4 prostate cancer. Kirkby was by his side as he delivered his final messages — including telling her how much he loved her and requesting that her younger brother Matthew walk her down the aisle someday.

"I was a big daddy's girl," Kirkby said simply.

To cope with her loss, Kirkby turned to pottery — a hobby she's had since she was six years old. She spends 10 to 25 hours per week with "clay dusted fingers" at the Arts Center Lake Placid, creating handmade ceramic pins.

For these Olympics, she brought over **100 handmade pins** to trade — part of a collection of more than 2,000 she's made since July. Each pin features images of women's winter sports events and athletes, part of her mission to promote women's sports during this historic Games.

"My sport is making its Olympic debut. How can I make the most of this moment to try and promote women's sports?" Kirkby explained.

## Women's Doubles Luge Makes Historic Olympic Debut

Speaking of history, Kirkby's event — women's doubles luge — is making its first-ever Olympic appearance at these Games.

Kirkby and her partner Chevonne Forgan will compete at the Cortina Sliding Centre this week, racing down the track at speeds that can exceed 80 mph while lying on a sled roughly the size of a cafeteria tray.

The addition of women's doubles luge to the Olympic program represents a significant step forward for gender equality in winter sports. Men have been competing in doubles luge since the 1964 Innsbruck Olympics — that's a 62-year head start.

For Kirkby, this isn't just about personal achievement. It's about being a pioneer for future generations of female lugers.

## What's Next for Sophia Kirkby at Milan-Cortina 2026?

With competition heating up and Valentine's Day approaching, the next few days promise to be eventful for America's most-watched Olympic athlete.

Will she medal in the debut of women's doubles luge? Will she find love among the 2,900+ athletes gathered in the Olympic Village? Will she expand her search to the stands?

One thing's for certain: whether Kirkby leaves Milan-Cortina with a medal, a boyfriend, or both — she's already won the internet.

Follow her social media for updates. You know you want to.
