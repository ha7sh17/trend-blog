Super Bowl 2026 commercials have officially broken the internet. While the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks battled it out on the field at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, another fierce competition was happening during the commercial breaks—one that cost brands up to $10 million for just 30 seconds of airtime.

If you missed the game or were busy refreshing the snack table, don't worry. We've rounded up the best Super Bowl LX commercials, complete with all the celebrity cameos, viral moments, and marketing genius that made this year's ad lineup one for the record books.

## Why Super Bowl 2026 Commercials Cost More Than Ever

This year's Super Bowl commercials hit an all-time high in terms of pricing. According to NBC, the average 30-second spot commanded around **$8 million**, with premium placements during high-stakes moments selling for **over $10 million**. That's a significant jump from last year's average of $7.5 million.

Why the price increase? Simple math: eyeballs. Super Bowl 59 drew a record-breaking **127.7 million viewers**, and Super Bowl LX was expected to match or exceed that number. For brands, there's no bigger stage to make a splash.

Interestingly, about **40% of this year's advertisers were first-timers** on the Super Bowl stage. Tech companies dominated the ad inventory, though NBC's definition of "tech" stretched to include platforms like Uber Eats. Traditional auto brands, once a Super Bowl staple, took a back seat with only two companies running spots this year.

## Best Super Bowl 2026 Commercials: Our Top Picks

### Bud Light's "Keg" — Peyton Manning, Shane Gillis, and Post Malone

Peyton Manning proved once again that his second career as an ad pitchman might be even more legendary than his NFL days. Teaming up with comedian Shane Gillis and Post Malone for the second year running, the trio delivered pure comedy gold.

The premise? Manning holds up his glass of Bud Light at a wedding, declaring it his "first beer of the wedding." When Post Malone asks if there's enough for everyone, Manning points to a giant keg rolling into the ceremony. Naturally, the keg escapes down a hill, sending the entire wedding party—bride, groom, and all—tumbling after it.

It's silly, it's chaotic, and it's exactly what we expect from Bud Light. Touchdown.

### Oakley Meta Performance AI Glasses — A Star-Studded Tech Showcase

Oakley went big this year, unveiling their new AI-powered smart glasses with a commercial that felt like a highlight reel of athletic excellence. Former Seahawks legend **Marshawn Lynch** kicked things off by literally *skydiving*, because of course Beast Mode can't do anything normal.

The ad continued with appearances from skateboarding prodigy **Sky Brown**, cyclist **Kate Courtney**, and golfer **Akshay Bhatia**, each demonstrating the glasses' features in their respective sports. Internet sensation **iShowSpeed** and legendary filmmaker **Spike Lee** rounded out the cast, giving the ad a cultural relevance that extended far beyond sports.

### Novartis Tight Ends Ad — Gronk Gets Vulnerable (Sort Of)

In perhaps the most unexpected Super Bowl commercial of 2026, Novartis assembled an all-star roster of NFL tight ends for a prostate cancer awareness campaign. **George Kittle**, **Rob Gronkowski**, **Tony Gonzalez**, and Jake Olson appeared in relaxing spa-like settings while calming music played.

Then came the twist. Super Bowl-winning coach **Bruce Arians** explained why these tight ends were so relaxed—they'd learned that a simple blood test can detect prostate cancer early. When Arians asked Gronk to demonstrate what he'd taught them, the former Patriots star did what only Gronk could do: literally relaxed his tight end.

It was hilarious, oddly heartwarming, and genuinely important. Well played, Novartis.

### Oikos — Derrick Henry Throws a Dime

The **Baltimore Ravens** running back **Derrick Henry** is known for his punishing rushing style, but this Oikos commercial showcased his surprising arm talent. The spot features Henry and actress **Kathryn Hahn** on a San Francisco trolley tour.

When the trolley struggles to climb one of the city's famous hills, Hahn jumps out to push—handing her Oikos yogurt to Henry. After she successfully gets the trolley moving (of course she does), she realizes her snack is still with Henry. No problem. Henry launches the yogurt with a throw that would make his quarterback **Lamar Jackson** jealous.

### Michelob Ultra — Kurt Russell's Ski School

Playing into the **2026 Winter Olympics** hype, Michelob Ultra delivered a commercial that was equal parts inspirational and absurd. Actor **Kurt Russell** spots **Lewis Pullman** losing a ski race and takes him under his wing for a training montage worthy of an 80s sports movie.

The payoff? Pullman wins the next race by landing a backflip, earning approving nods from Olympic snowboarding champion **Chloe Kim** and Stanley Cup winner **T.J. Oshie**. It's silly, it's charming, and it makes you want a beer. Mission accomplished.

### Ro — Serena Williams' GLP-1 Journey

Tennis icon **Serena Williams** brought authenticity to her Super Bowl spot for Ro, a health company offering GLP-1 medications. Williams openly discussed her fitness journey, including losing **34 pounds** with the help of Ro's services.

In an era where celebrity health endorsements often feel hollow, Williams' straightforward approach felt refreshing. She's not pretending she did it with just diet and exercise—she's being transparent about modern tools that helped her achieve her goals.

## The Wild World of Super Bowl Commercial Betting

Here's a 2026 twist that caught everyone off guard: you could actually **bet on Super Bowl commercials** this year. Prediction market platforms **Kalshi** and **Polymarket** offered contracts on everything from which brands would advertise to which celebrities would appear.

Want to bet on whether Sydney Sweeney, Timothée Chalamet, or Harry Styles would show up in an ad? You could. The contracts traded like stocks, with prices fluctuating based on insider information and market sentiment.

This led to some fascinating (and legally murky) moments. Spotify contracts spiked on January 19th, going from $0.35 to $0.69 in a single day before settling back down. Was someone tipping off traders? The CFTC has raised insider trading concerns, though experts doubt the agency has the resources to seriously police the space.

## What Made Super Bowl LX Ads Different

Several trends defined the **Super Bowl 2026 commercial** landscape:

**Nostalgia marketing** continued its reign, with returning partnerships like Manning/Gillis/Malone proving that familiarity breeds... more views.

**Health and wellness** took center stage. From Novartis' prostate cancer awareness to Serena Williams' weight loss journey, brands weren't afraid to get serious (while still entertaining).

**Tech integration** wasn't just about tech companies advertising—it was about showcasing how technology enhances everyday life. Oakley's AI glasses felt futuristic but practical.

**Athletes as pitchmen** dominated more than ever. The NFL isn't just selling football anymore; it's selling personalities, and brands are paying premium prices to rent that star power.
