Solomon Tuliaupupu is rewriting the rules of college football. The Montana Grizzlies linebacker was just granted a ninth year of eligibility by the NCAA, making him one of the longest-tenured college athletes in modern history. But this isn't just a story about hanging around campus too long—it's a masterclass in resilience, reinvention, and knowing when to pivot.

## From High School Legend to Injury Nightmare

Back in 2017, Solomon Tuliaupupu was the hottest defensive prospect in the country. The Mater Dei High School standout collected every accolade imaginable: All-American honors, the Dick Butkus High School Linebacker of the Year award, and USA Today's Defensive Player of the Year. When he signed with USC as a four-star recruit, NFL scouts were already circling.

Then everything fell apart.

Tuliaupupu's freshman year at USC ended before it started. A preseason foot injury required surgery and cost him the entire 2018 season. He redshirted, regrouped, and prepared for his sophomore campaign. But fate had other plans. Another preseason injury—this time to his knee—meant another surgery, another lost season.

The pattern became cruel and repetitive. A knee injury in 2020. Another setback in 2023. By the time Tuliaupupu finally saw meaningful playing time, he was already years behind his recruiting classmates, many of whom were collecting NFL paychecks.

## The Van Wilder Comparison Misses the Point

When news broke that a 25-year-old linebacker would be starting his ninth year of college, the "Van Wilder" jokes wrote themselves. But comparing Solomon Tuliaupupu to the party-animal movie character completely misses what makes this story remarkable.

While his body kept failing him on the field, Tuliaupupu refused to waste his time off it. During his seemingly endless rehab stints, he was quietly stacking degrees:

- **Bachelor's degree** in Business Administration from USC's Marshall School of Business
- **Master's degree** in Project Management from USC's Bovard College
- **Graduate certificate** in Entrepreneurship from the University of Montana (in progress)

That's not someone refusing to grow up. That's someone playing chess while everyone else thinks he's playing checkers.

## Montana Became His Second Chance

After seven years in the USC system—with only three seasons of actual playing time to show for it—Tuliaupupu transferred to Montana in 2025. The move made perfect sense. The FCS level offered more playing opportunities, and Montana's program under legendary coach Bobby Hauck was legitimate.

The gamble paid off immediately. In his first full season with the Grizzlies, Tuliaupupu looked like the player everyone expected a decade ago. He finished with 43 total tackles, two sacks, and two forced fumbles as Montana stormed to the FCS playoff semifinals. The lateral quickness that made him a high school sensation was still there. So was the football IQ that scouts had raved about.

Now, with Bobby Kennedy taking over as head coach after Hauck's departure to Illinois, Tuliaupupu will be a crucial leader for a program in transition.

## What the NCAA's Decision Really Means

The NCAA granting Tuliaupupu a ninth year of eligibility isn't just bureaucratic paperwork—it's an acknowledgment of extraordinary circumstances. The governing body essentially agreed that losing five seasons to injury constitutes grounds for additional time.

This sets an interesting precedent. As medical waivers and eligibility extensions become more common in the NIL era, Tuliaupupu's case could be referenced in future appeals. Athletes who suffer multiple season-ending injuries may now have a template for extending their college careers.

For Montana, the decision is pure upside. They get a battle-tested, highly intelligent linebacker who has seen it all. For Tuliaupupu, it's one more chance to play the game he loves—and pad his already impressive resume.

## The Bigger Lesson Here

Solomon Tuliaupupu's story resonates because it challenges our assumptions about what "success" looks like in college athletics. Most high school All-Americans either make the NFL or fade into obscurity. Tuliaupupu did neither.

Instead of letting injuries define him as a "bust," he reframed his entire college experience. The extra years that might have felt like purgatory became opportunities. The medical redshirts that crushed his NFL dreams became chances to earn degrees that most athletes never pursue.

At 25, Tuliaupupu will finally wrap up his college football career. He probably won't get drafted. But he'll walk away with multiple degrees, zero student debt, and a story that screams "hire this person" to any employer with sense.
