Tom Hanks is back on the bridge. **Greyhound 2** has officially started production in Australia, bringing back the beloved captain for another round of naval warfare against the backdrop of World War II. After the massive success of the original film on Apple TV+, fans finally have confirmation that the sequel is really happening—and it's bigger than ever.

## Why Greyhound 2 Is Trending Right Now

The entertainment world is buzzing because production on Greyhound 2 just kicked off in Australia, with several major casting announcements dropping simultaneously. Stephen Graham, fresh off his Emmy-winning performance in Netflix's *Adolescence*, has officially closed his deal to return alongside Hanks. The timing couldn't be better for a war epic that promises to expand the scope of the original's intense submarine warfare.

Apple Studios is clearly betting big on this franchise. With support from Screen NSW's Made in NSW Fund, the production has the backing to deliver the kind of large-scale naval sequences that made the first film such a visual spectacle.

## Tom Hanks Returns as Captain Krause

What makes Greyhound 2 particularly exciting is Tom Hanks' deep involvement. He's not just reprising his role as Captain Ernest Krause—he's also penning the screenplay, just like he did for the original. This level of creative control means the sequel maintains the authentic, character-driven approach that distinguished the first film from typical action blockbusters.

The new story takes Captain Krause and the Greyhound crew from the beaches of Normandy all the way to the Pacific Ocean. It's a significant expansion from the original's North Atlantic setting, suggesting more diverse naval engagements and a broader view of the war's naval theater.

For Hanks, who has built a career on portraying ordinary heroes in extraordinary circumstances, Captain Krause represents another thoughtful exploration of leadership under pressure. His commitment to returning—and writing—suggests there's a story here worth telling.

## Full Cast Lineup for the Greyhound Sequel

The Greyhound 2 cast brings back familiar faces while adding fresh talent:

**Returning Cast:**
- **Tom Hanks** as Captain Ernest Krause
- **Stephen Graham** as Charlie Cole
- **Elisabeth Shue** as Evelyn
- **Rob Morgan** as Cleveland

**New Addition:**
- **Jack Patten** (currently starring in MGM+'s *Robin Hood*) joins in an undisclosed role

Director **Aaron Schneider**, a former cinematographer who helmed the original, returns to the captain's chair. Producer **Gary Goetzman** is also back, maintaining continuity with the creative team that made the first film work so well.

Stephen Graham's return is particularly noteworthy. The British actor has been on a remarkable run lately, from his acclaimed work in *Adolescence* to his upcoming role in *Peaky Blinders: The Immortal Man*. His chemistry with Hanks was a highlight of the original Greyhound, and their reunion promises more of those grounded, tension-filled character moments.

## What Made the Original Greyhound a Hit

To understand why Greyhound 2 generates so much anticipation, it helps to revisit what made the original special. Released on Apple TV+ in July 2020, *Greyhound* became the platform's biggest opening weekend release at the time.

The film followed Captain Krause, a longtime Navy veteran taking his first command. His mission: protect a convoy of 37 ships carrying thousands of soldiers and vital supplies across the Atlantic. For five harrowing days without air cover, Krause and his small force of three escort ships had to navigate "the Black Pit"—a stretch of ocean swarming with Nazi U-boats.

What set *Greyhound* apart was its intense focus on the moment-to-moment decisions of command. Based on C.S. Forester's novel *The Good Shepherd*, the film earned an Oscar nomination for Best Sound—fitting recognition for a movie that made you feel every depth charge and torpedo strike.

## Pacific Theater: The New Battleground

The sequel's shift to the Pacific represents a major change in tone and scope. While the Battle of the Atlantic was about convoy protection and submarine hunting, the Pacific Theater was famous for its island-hopping campaigns, carrier battles, and some of the war's most brutal combat.

Moving from Normandy to the Pacific also suggests the film may span a significant period of the war, potentially showing how Captain Krause and his crew evolved as the conflict's nature changed. The Pacific required different tactics, different ships, and a different mindset—all of which could provide rich material for Hanks' screenplay.

For audiences, this means Greyhound 2 likely won't be a simple rehash of the original's formula. Different ocean, different enemy tactics, different stakes.

## When Will Greyhound 2 Release?

Apple Studios hasn't announced an official release date, but with production now underway, a 2027 release looks most likely. The first film had a notably long post-production period, partly due to COVID disruptions, so the sequel may follow a similar timeline.

The bigger question is whether Apple will give Greyhound 2 a theatrical release. The original was intended for theaters before the pandemic forced a streaming-only debut. Since then, Apple has been selective about theatrical releases, focusing on prestige titles like *Killers of the Flower Moon*.

Given Greyhound 2's scope and star power, a limited theatrical run seems possible—especially if Apple wants to position the film for awards consideration.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Greyhound 2 based on a book like the original?

The original *Greyhound* was adapted from C.S. Forester's 1955 novel *The Good Shepherd*. There's no indication that Greyhound 2 is based on a specific book—Tom Hanks wrote an original screenplay continuing Captain Krause's story into the Pacific Theater.

### Where is Greyhound 2 being filmed?

Production is taking place in Australia with support from Screen NSW's Made in NSW Fund. Australia has become a popular destination for large-scale film productions due to its facilities, tax incentives, and diverse filming locations.

### Will Greyhound 2 be on Apple TV+ or in theaters?

## The Bottom Line on Greyhound 2

**Greyhound 2** represents exactly the kind of sequel worth getting excited about. With Tom Hanks returning in front of and behind the camera, a talented cast reassembling, and a story that genuinely expands the scope of the original, this isn't a cash-grab follow-up—it's a passion project from people who clearly believe in the material.

The shift from Atlantic to Pacific opens up new dramatic possibilities while maintaining the character-driven intensity that made the first film resonate. For fans of thoughtful war films that prioritize tension and leadership over spectacle, Greyhound 2 is shaping up to be one of the most anticipated releases of 2027.

Production has only just begun, so expect more casting news and story details to emerge in the coming months. One thing seems certain: Captain Krause's next voyage is one worth waiting for.
