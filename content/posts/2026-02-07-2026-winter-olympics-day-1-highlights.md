The **2026 Winter Olympics** are officially underway, and Day 1 in Milano-Cortina delivered exactly the kind of edge-of-your-seat drama that makes the Games unmissable. From a Swiss phenom conquering one of the most dangerous ski courses ever designed to an American legend defying medical odds, here's everything you need to know about the opening day of competition.

## Franjo von Allmen Claims Gold on the Dreaded Stelvio

The biggest story of Day 1? Twenty-three-year-old Swiss skier **Franjo von Allmen** just won Olympic gold on his very first Games appearance.

And he didn't just win. He absolutely dominated the men's downhill on the infamous **Stelvio slope in Bormio**—a course so brutal that skiers have nicknamed it the "Ribbon of Death."

Von Allmen's performance left spectators streaming out of the venue before the race even finished. They'd seen enough. The young Swiss star, who only made his World Cup debut in 2023, has rapidly become one of the best speed skiers on the planet.

Italy's hopes for a home gold were dashed as **Giovanni Franzoni** and **Dominik Paris** settled for silver and bronze respectively. Both skiers pushed hard, but von Allmen's time proved untouchable.

Here's a fun fact about the new Olympic champion: his hometown of Boltigen, Switzerland, has literally named a sausage after him. The "Silberblitz-Wurscht" (Silver Lightning Sausage) will run you about $15.44 per pound if you want to taste victory.

## Why the Stelvio Course Terrifies the World's Best Skiers

If you're wondering why winning this particular downhill is such a big deal, let's talk about what makes the **2026 Olympic downhill course** so terrifying.

The Stelvio is 3,442 meters of pure adrenaline and fear. World Cup skier Leo Ducros describes it as "a mix between Wolverine and Batman—dark because of the shadow, its icy surface hard like Wolverine's claws. It's almost mystic. Nothing can prepare you for the Stelvio."

The numbers are staggering:

- **1,023-meter vertical drop**
- **Starting gradient of 63 percent**
- **Top speeds exceeding 87 mph (140 km/h)**
- **The San Pietro jump launches skiers 45 meters through the air**

One ski coach compared racing the Stelvio to "rollerblading down 3,000 stairs at 62 mph in poor light." And that's not hyperbole.

The course claimed victims even before race day. Norway's Fredrik Møller was airlifted to a hospital after dislocating his shoulder during training. Austria's Daniel Hemetsberger walked away with a swollen eye and bloodied nose after crashing into safety netting.

"You can lose everything at any time," French skier Leo Ducros warned before the race. He wasn't wrong.

## Lindsey Vonn Defies the Odds (Again)

Perhaps the most inspiring story of the **Milano Cortina Winter Olympics** so far involves an athlete who hasn't even competed yet.

**Lindsey Vonn**, the American skiing legend, completed her second training run on Saturday despite having "completely ruptured" her ACL just eight days earlier on January 30.

Read that again. She ruptured her ACL last week and she's still preparing to race.

Vonn posted a time of 1 minute and 38.28 seconds—even faster than her first training run on Friday. At 41 years old, she's attempting to compete in her fifth Winter Olympics, and nothing seems capable of stopping her.

The women's downhill event is scheduled for Sunday, and the entire sports world will be watching to see if Vonn can pull off what would be one of the most remarkable athletic achievements in Olympic history.

## Historic Moments: Laila Edwards Makes History

While the alpine events grabbed the biggest headlines, **Laila Edwards** quietly made history at the Milano Rho Ice Hockey Arena.

Edwards became the **first Black woman to play for the U.S. women's hockey team at the Winter Olympics** when she took the ice on Thursday. Team USA dominated the Czech Republic 5-1 in their opening preliminary round match.

"It means a lot. I take a lot of pride in it," Edwards told reporters afterward. "Representation matters, no matter how uncomfortable it can be. It's for the next generation. Maybe a little girl doesn't see me, who looks like her. That's what's really important."

Her story has an unexpected connection to pop culture: the Kelce brothers have apparently helped her family along the way. Edwards' appearance marks another step forward for diversity in winter sports, which have historically lacked representation.

## Eileen Gu Survives a Scare in Freeski Slopestyle

Over at the Livigno Snow Park, two-time Olympic gold medalist **Eileen Gu** gave fans a brief heart attack.

The freeski superstar fell during her first qualifying run, putting her spot in the final in jeopardy. But Gu is Gu for a reason—she cruised through her second run with a score of 75.30 to comfortably advance.

The women's freeski slopestyle final should be a highlight of the coming days, with Gu looking to add to her already impressive Olympic medal collection.

## What's Next at the 2026 Winter Olympics

Day 1 was just the appetizer. Here's what to look forward to as the **Milano Cortina Games** continue:

- **Women's Downhill:** Lindsey Vonn's incredible comeback attempt
- **Figure Skating:** Team events begin
- **Speed Skating:** Multiple medal events on the horizon
- **Curling:** Round-robin action continues
- **Snowboarding:** Halfpipe and slopestyle qualifications

The weather in the Italian Alps has been variable—spectators went from T-shirts to winter coats within 20 minutes on Saturday—but the action on the slopes has been consistently hot.
