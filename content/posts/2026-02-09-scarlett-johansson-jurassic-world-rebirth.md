Scarlett Johansson has officially taken the reins of one of Hollywood's most beloved franchises with **Jurassic World Rebirth**, and the original Jurassic Park star Sam Neill couldn't be prouder. In a heartwarming twist that spans nearly three decades of cinema history, Neill has revealed that watching Johansson lead the dinosaur franchise feels like "a family affair."

## Sam Neill and Scarlett Johansson: A Father-Daughter Connection

The connection between Neill and Johansson goes back to 1998's *The Horse Whisperer*, directed by and starring Robert Redford. In that film, Neill played Robert MacLean, the father of Grace—a 12-year-old Johansson in one of her earliest major roles. The movie followed their family's journey after Grace suffers a tragic accident alongside her horse.

"I'm very fond of Scarlett," Neill told Entertainment Weekly ahead of Super Bowl LX. "I feel like it's a family affair here. We were with Kristin Scott Thomas and Robert Redford, and we were out in Montana, and I was playing her dad."

Now, 27 years later, Neill is watching his former on-screen daughter take charge of the franchise he helped build.

## Jurassic World Rebirth: Johansson's Badass New Role

In **Jurassic World Rebirth** (2025), Johansson stars as Zora Bennett, a special-ops expert hired by a pharmaceutical company to infiltrate the last known dinosaur haven. Her mission? Extract DNA from the three largest creatures across land, sea, and sky. It's a far cry from the injured teenager she played in *The Horse Whisperer*, and Neill approves wholeheartedly.

"I feel like my daughter, she's capable of kicking any ass," Neill said with a laugh. "She gets it from me."

The film also stars Jonathan Bailey as Dr. Henry Loomis and Mahershala Ali as Duncan Kincaid. Directed by Gareth Edwards, *Rebirth* marks a new chapter for the franchise while honoring its roots.

## The Alan Grant Easter Egg That Surprised Sam Neill

Speaking of honoring roots, *Jurassic World Rebirth* includes a subtle but meaningful callback to Neill's iconic paleontologist character. Jonathan Bailey's Dr. Henry Loomis casually mentions that he studied under Alan Grant—a detail that even Neill himself didn't see coming.

"I was surprised," Neill admitted. "It's nice when these things refer to each other, and I thought that was respectful and good."

Director Gareth Edwards explained the thoughtful detail: "It's actually the only reference to anybody from another Jurassic film." Edwards even designed a small patch for Bailey's character's bag featuring Snakewater Canyon—the Montana dig site from the opening scene of the original *Jurassic Park*. The idea was that Henry Loomis had worked there as a kid.

Neill hasn't met Bailey yet but is looking forward to it. "I look forward to that," he said of PEOPLE's current Sexiest Man Alive.

## The Original Trio Reunites for Super Bowl LX

While Johansson carries the torch in theaters, Neill is reuniting with his original *Jurassic Park* co-stars Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum for a different kind of prehistoric adventure: an Xfinity Super Bowl commercial.

Directed by Taika Waititi (*Thor: Ragnarok*, *The Hunt for the Wilderpeople*), the ad reimagines what would have happened if Jurassic Park's security systems had never failed. With Xfinity's reliable Wi-Fi, the dinosaurs stay in their pens, and everyone enjoys a peaceful island vacation.

The commercial recreates classic scenes from the 1993 film, including the iconic T. rex exhibit in the rain and Ellie Sattler's famous "I think we're back in business" moment.

"Nothing I was wearing was original," Neill revealed about the costumes. He had previously auctioned off his Timberland boots and *Dominion* hat for charity. "So they made me a new uniform. I did not keep it this time, just in case they want another reunion."

## A Franchise Passing the Torch

There's something poetic about Scarlett Johansson leading the Jurassic franchise while Sam Neill watches from the sidelines with paternal pride. Hollywood loves a good legacy story, but this one comes with a genuine personal connection that dates back almost three decades.

When Neill says it feels like "a family affair," he's not just being diplomatic. He watched Johansson grow from a 12-year-old kid on a Montana film set to one of the biggest movie stars on the planet. Now she's taking over the franchise that defined his career.

And if the Alan Grant callout in *Rebirth* is any indication, the new generation isn't forgetting where this whole thing started.
