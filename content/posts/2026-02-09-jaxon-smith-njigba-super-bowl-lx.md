Jaxon Smith-Njigba isn't just playing in Super Bowl LX—he's the reason the Seattle Seahawks are there in the first place. The third-year wide receiver has transformed from a promising rookie into the most unstoppable offensive weapon in football, and on Sunday, February 9, 2026, he'll face his biggest challenge yet: proving he can dominate on the biggest stage.

## Jaxon Smith-Njigba's Historic 2025 Season

Numbers don't lie, and JSN's numbers this season are almost absurd. The Seahawks star led the entire NFL with **1,793 receiving yards**—yes, you read that right. He caught 119 passes for 10 touchdowns during the regular season, earning him the **2025 Offensive Player of the Year** award.

But here's what makes those stats even more impressive: Smith-Njigba did this in a run-first Seattle offense. The Seahawks weren't airing it out 50 times a game. They were grinding out wins with Kenneth Walker III pounding the rock, complemented by one of the league's most intimidating defenses. And still, JSN found ways to absolutely feast.

Out of 19 total games this season (including playoffs), Smith-Njigba recorded at least 70 receiving yards in 17 of them. The two games he didn't? The Seahawks outscored their opponents by a combined 67-6. When you're winning by that much, you don't need to force-feed your star receiver.

## From Ohio State to NFL Stardom

For those who've been paying attention, JSN's dominance isn't surprising. This is the same player who rewrote the Rose Bowl record book as an Ohio State Buckeye, torching defenses for 347 receiving yards in a single game. That performance put the football world on notice: Jaxon Smith-Njigba was different.

The Seahawks selected him with the 20th pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, and while his rookie season showed flashes of brilliance, it was under offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak this year that JSN truly unlocked his potential.

Kubiak's system moved Smith-Njigba around the formation—inside, outside, and even lining up in the backfield. That versatility made him virtually impossible to game-plan for. Defensive coordinators couldn't just bracket him with one coverage scheme because they never knew where he'd line up next.

## The Route-Running Artistry That Defines JSN

What separates Jaxon Smith-Njigba from other elite receivers isn't just speed or size—it's craftsmanship. The man is a route-running savant.

His releases off the line are works of art. He pairs different release techniques so defenders can't predict what route is coming. His double-moves are the best in the NFL. He sells fakes with such conviction that corners regularly bite, leaving him wide open for Sam Darnold to hit.

"He can do everything from every spot on the field," Patriots cornerback Christian Gonzalez said at Super Bowl Opening Night. "He's a smooth route-runner, can run every route, and he's just an amazing player."

When your opponent is calling you "an amazing player" before the biggest game of his life, you know you've earned respect.

## The Super Bowl LX Matchup: JSN vs Christian Gonzalez

Sunday's game will feature one of the most anticipated individual matchups in recent Super Bowl history: Smith-Njigba versus Gonzalez.

Gonzalez, a fellow 2023 first-round pick, has developed into one of the NFL's best cornerbacks. This season, he allowed only 35 receptions on 76 targets—a 46.1% completion rate—for just 357 yards and a single touchdown. He earned Pro Bowl honors and has been lockdown in the playoffs.

According to Patriots cornerback Carlton Davis, the game plan is simple: "We're going to have Gonzo follow him."

But here's the catch—literally. Because Seattle moves JSN everywhere, Gonzalez won't be able to shadow him on every snap. When Smith-Njigba motions into the backfield or shifts to the slot, different Patriots defenders will be tasked with covering him.

In the Seahawks' NFC Championship victory over the Rams, Smith-Njigba caught 10 passes for 153 yards and a touchdown. One of those touchdowns came on a play where he started as an outside receiver, motioned into the backfield, and beat his man with a 14-yard scoring reception. That kind of pre-snap deception is what makes him so dangerous.

## Sam Darnold and the Seahawks Offense Supporting Cast

Smith-Njigba doesn't do this alone. Quarterback Sam Darnold has completely revived his career in Seattle, silencing all the doubters who wrote him off after his struggles with the Jets and Panthers.

The Seahawks offense ranked third in scoring and eighth in total yards this season. Running back Kenneth Walker III is a physical beast who keeps defenses honest. Cooper Kupp, acquired before the season, provides another veteran receiving option. Rashid Shaheed stretches the field vertically.

But make no mistake—JSN is the engine that makes this offense go. He accounted for roughly **45% of the Seahawks' receiving yards** this season. That's an almost absurd share of production for any receiver.

## What the Patriots Must Do to Win

New England's path to victory is clear: they must slow down Jaxon Smith-Njigba.

The Patriots defense has been excellent this postseason, and Drake Maye has led a resurgent offense that nobody saw coming. But if JSN goes for 150+ yards and multiple touchdowns, it won't matter what the Patriots do offensively.

Carlton Davis believes this Seahawks offense isn't as explosive as the 2020 Chiefs team he faced in Super Bowl LV. That may be true from a pure firepower standpoint. But Smith-Njigba is a one-man wrecking crew, and underestimating him would be a fatal mistake.

"He's a real cool, calm, collected kind of guy," Davis said about Gonzalez. "He's got a lot of poise."

Gonzalez will need every bit of that poise on Sunday.
