Eileen Gu is trending everywhere right now, and it's not just because of her silver medal performance. The 22-year-old American-born skier has sparked a firestorm of controversy at the 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics after weighing in on President Trump's criticism of US Olympian Hunter Hess—all while wearing the Chinese flag on her uniform.

The backlash has been swift and brutal. Former NBA player Enes Kanter Freedom called her a "traitor." Political commentators are questioning her silence on China's human rights record. And social media is absolutely roasting her for criticizing American leadership while cashing $23 million checks from Chinese companies.

So what's really going on here? Let's break down why Eileen Gu chose China, why she's drawing so much heat, and what this controversy tells us about the complicated intersection of sports, politics, and money.

## Who Is Eileen Gu and Why Does She Compete for China?

Eileen Gu was born and raised in San Francisco, California. She's American through and through—she grew up skiing at Lake Tahoe, attended an elite private high school, and is currently a student at Stanford University studying international relations.

But when it came time to choose which country to represent at the Olympics, Gu chose China.

Her explanation? She wants to honor her mother's heritage and believes she can have a bigger impact inspiring young athletes in China than in the United States.

"In the U.S., growing up, I had so many amazing idols to look up to," Gu told the Associated Press during the 2022 Beijing Olympics. "But in China, I feel like there are a lot fewer of those. I'd have a much greater impact in China than in the U.S."

It's a decision that has followed her with controversy ever since. And at Milan-Cortina 2026, that controversy just exploded.

## The Trump Controversy That Sparked the Backlash

The drama started when US skier Hunter Hess expressed "mixed emotions" about representing America at the Olympics, citing political concerns about the current state of the country.

President Trump fired back on social media, calling Hess a "real loser" and writing: "If that's the case, he shouldn't have tried out for the Team, and it's too bad he's on it. Very hard to root for someone like this."

Enter Eileen Gu.

Speaking to reporters Monday, Gu criticized the political controversy surrounding the Olympics:

"I'm sorry that the headline that is eclipsing the Olympics has to be something so unrelated to the spirit of the Games. It really runs contrary to everything the Olympics should be," she said. "The whole point of sport is to bring people together."

She also claimed she had been "caught in the crossfire" herself, adding: "As someone who has got caught in the crossfire before, I feel sorry for the athletes."

That's when things got ugly.

## Why Critics Are Calling Eileen Gu a "Traitor"

The backlash wasn't about Gu criticizing Trump—plenty of athletes do that. It was about what critics see as a stunning double standard.

Enes Kanter Freedom, the former NBA player who has been outspoken about China's human rights record, didn't hold back:

"Eileen Gu is a traitor. She was born in America, raised in America, lives in America, and chose to compete against her own country for the worst human rights abuser on the planet, China," Kanter wrote on X.

He continued: "She built her fame in a free country, then chose to represent an authoritarian regime while cashing in on endorsements linked by watchdog groups to mass detention and forced labor camps. When human rights come up, she disappears."

Hudson Institute senior fellow Michael Sobolik made a similar point: "No mention about whether the CCP's genocide of Uyghurs 'runs contrary to everything the Olympics should be.' No criticism of Xi Jinping for the imprisonment of Jimmy Lai, Pastor Ezra Jin, Gulshan Abbas, or China's many other political prisoners."

The criticism essentially boils down to this: Gu is comfortable criticizing American politics while remaining completely silent about China's alleged human rights abuses, including the treatment of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang.

## Inside Eileen Gu's $23 Million Empire

Here's where things get even more complicated: Eileen Gu isn't just an Olympic athlete. She's a business empire.

According to Forbes, Gu earned $23.1 million in 2025 alone, making her the fourth-highest-paid female athlete in the world—ahead of stars like Naomi Osaka and Caitlin Clark. She's also the highest-paid Winter Olympic athlete, period.

The kicker? Less than 1% of that money comes from competition winnings.

The rest comes from endorsement deals, including partnerships with Chinese companies like the Bank of China, plus Western brands like Red Bull, Porsche, Louis Vuitton, and Victoria's Secret.

Gu has built a "multi-hyphenate" brand that goes far beyond skiing. She's a model who walks runways in Paris and Barcelona. She's a Stanford student who does homework on international flights. She's a social media influencer with over 2 million Instagram followers.

"I'm a full-time student who's really athletic," she told Time magazine. "I can have a conversation with a physicist and stand my ground, and I can also walk a runway show the next day."

It's an impressive empire. But critics argue that representing China—and staying silent on its human rights record—is the price she pays to keep those lucrative Chinese endorsement deals flowing.

## Eileen Gu's Olympic Record and Milan 2026 Performance

Whatever you think of the controversy, there's no denying Gu's athletic talent.

At the 2022 Beijing Olympics, she made history as the first athlete to win three freestyle skiing medals at a single Games—gold in big air and halfpipe, silver in slopestyle.

Now at Milan-Cortina 2026, she's already added another silver medal in slopestyle. She's slated to compete in big air and halfpipe later this month, where she'll be the favorite for gold.

That means Gu could leave these Olympics with five or six career medals, cementing her status as one of the greatest freestyle skiers of all time.

But the asterisk next to her legacy keeps getting bigger.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why doesn't Eileen Gu compete for the United States?

Eileen Gu chose to represent China to honor her mother's heritage and because she believes she can have a greater impact inspiring young athletes in China. She had a guaranteed spot on Team USA's freestyle squad but switched allegiance before the 2022 Beijing Olympics.

### How much money does Eileen Gu make?

Eileen Gu earned an estimated $23.1 million in 2025, making her the highest-paid Winter Olympic athlete in the world. The vast majority of her income comes from endorsement deals with companies like Bank of China, Red Bull, Porsche, and Louis Vuitton—not from competition prize money.

### Has Eileen Gu spoken out about China's human rights record?

No. Despite being vocal about American political issues, Eileen Gu has never publicly commented on China's alleged human rights abuses, including the treatment of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang. Critics argue this silence is hypocritical given her willingness to criticize US politics.

## The Bigger Picture: Sports, Money, and Politics

The Eileen Gu controversy isn't really about one skier. It's about the impossible position athletes find themselves in when sports, money, and geopolitics collide.

Gu has masterfully built a personal brand worth tens of millions of dollars. She's used her platform to inspire young women in China and break barriers as a biracial athlete. And she's undeniably one of the most talented freestyle skiers the sport has ever seen.

But in choosing to represent China while staying silent on its human rights record—and then wading into American political controversies—she's opened herself up to accusations of hypocrisy that won't go away anytime soon.

As the Milan-Cortina Olympics continue, Eileen Gu will almost certainly add more medals to her collection. But the conversation around her legacy is about a lot more than gold and silver now.

The question everyone keeps asking: Can you criticize one country's politics while representing another—and never say a word about that country's human rights abuses?

For Eileen Gu, that question isn't going away.
