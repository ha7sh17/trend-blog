## Elizabeth Lemley Makes Olympic History in Stunning Gold Medal Performance

The 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics just witnessed one of the most dominant performances in freestyle skiing history. **Elizabeth Lemley**, a 20-year-old first-time Olympian from Colorado, captured the gold medal in women's moguls while her teammate **Jaelin Kauf** secured silver—giving Team USA an incredible 1-2 finish that had the American contingent in Livigno, Italy erupting in celebration.

As "The Star Spangled Banner" echoed through the snow sports cluster in Livigno for the first time at these Games, Lemley stood atop the podium with a score of 82.30, followed closely by Kauf at 80.77. France's Perrine Laffont rounded out the podium with bronze at 78.00.

## The Rise of Elizabeth Lemley: From Youth Games to Olympic Champion

Elizabeth Lemley's journey to Olympic gold reads like a script Hollywood would reject for being too perfect. At just 20 years old, she's the youngest member of the U.S. moguls team at the 2026 Winter Olympics—and now she's also an Olympic champion.

But those paying attention to freestyle skiing knew Lemley was special long before Livigno. She's a two-time gold medalist at the Youth Olympic Games, winning both duals moguls and team duals moguls. That experience at the highest level of youth competition clearly translated to the biggest stage of all.

Her blistering final run combined technical precision with fearless aggression, leaving the field behind and proving that sometimes the youngest competitor in the room is also the most dangerous.

## Jaelin Kauf's Remarkable Consistency: Back-to-Back Olympic Silver Medals

While Lemley's gold made headlines, Jaelin Kauf's silver medal tells an equally compelling story of sustained excellence. This marks Kauf's second consecutive Olympic silver medal in women's moguls, following her podium finish at the 2022 Beijing Games.

At 29, Kauf has defied the notion that moguls skiing is exclusively a young athlete's game.

"That doesn't define what I can do or accomplish in this sport. I truly think age is just a number. My mom showed me that my whole life," Kauf has said. "You can do whatever you want to do."

Kauf entered the 2026 Olympics in phenomenal form, having achieved 14 consecutive podiums—including eight victories—during the 2025 World Cup season. That run culminated in a dual moguls world title, cementing her status as one of the greatest moguls skiers of her generation.

## A Family Affair: The Kauf Skiing Dynasty

The Kauf family connection to moguls runs deep. Both of Jaelin's parents—Patti Sherman-Kauf and Scott Kauf—were multiple-time champions on the Pro Moguls Tour during the 1980s and '90s. Patti even competed while pregnant with Jaelin and later attempted to qualify for the Olympics at age 40.

"They understand competing at an elite level," Kauf explained to USA TODAY Sports. "They're always there as a shoulder to cry on, to celebrate with, whatever it is. And I know that they understand my emotions and feelings and the heartbreak, the upsets and the triumphs of the sport too."

Unlike Beijing, where COVID-19 restrictions forced Kauf's family to watch from home in Wyoming, this time was different. Her parents and brother Skyler were on hand at Livigno Aerials and Moguls Park to witness the historic moment in person.

## Defending Champion Jakara Anthony's Shocking Eighth-Place Finish

In one of the biggest upsets of the 2026 Winter Olympics so far, defending gold medalist Jakara Anthony of Australia finished a stunning eighth place. Anthony made a costly error with a bad turn in the middle of her first run, effectively ending her chances at defending her title.

The Australian's stumble opened the door for Team USA's dominance, and Lemley and Kauf walked right through it.

## What's Next: Dual Moguls Offers Another Shot at Gold

The good news for American freestyle skiing fans? There's more to come. For the first time in Olympic history, dual moguls has been added as a medal event at the Winter Games.

Jaelin Kauf will compete in the Freestyle Skiing Women's Dual Moguls on Saturday, February 14, giving her another opportunity to chase the gold that has eluded her in singles competition. Elizabeth Lemley will also look to add to her medal haul in the new event.

Given Kauf's world title in dual moguls from the 2025 season, she enters as one of the favorites.
