Amber Glenn is trending everywhere right now, and for good reason. The 26-year-old figure skater from Plano, Texas has become the face of American figure skating heading into the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan. After winning her third consecutive U.S. championship with a record-breaking performance, Glenn enters these Games as a genuine gold medal contender—something American women's figure skating hasn't had in two decades.

## Who is Amber Glenn? The Texas Skater Making History

Amber Glenn's story doesn't fit the typical figure skating narrative, and that's exactly what makes it so compelling. She started skating at age 5 at a mall rink in Frisco, Texas—a rink that existed largely because the Dallas Stars' late-90s success sparked an ice sports boom in North Texas. By the time she was in third grade, coaches had noticed her raw talent. By 14, she'd become the U.S. junior champion.

But here's where Glenn's path diverges from the usual prodigy-to-podium trajectory. Unlike most elite skaters who peak in their late teens, Glenn's journey took a darker turn. Around age 16, she battled severe depression, anxiety, and an eating disorder. The pressure of being a figure skating prodigy proved overwhelming.

"I didn't want to be on this earth anymore," Glenn has openly shared about that period.

She spent time in a mental health facility and stepped back from competitive skating to rediscover herself outside the sport. That decision to prioritize her mental health over medals may have delayed her rise to the top—but it also saved her career and her life.

## Amber Glenn's Path to the 2026 Winter Olympics

Glenn's recent dominance has been nothing short of remarkable. She's now a three-time U.S. champion, with her 2026 nationals performance setting a new American record in the short program. What changed?

A few things. First, she added the notoriously difficult triple axel to her arsenal during the pandemic in 2023. Only a handful of women in the world can land this jump consistently, and it immediately elevated Glenn into the sport's elite tier.

But the technical improvement is only part of the story. The bigger transformation was internal.

"I didn't fit the mold, and I tried so hard to fit into it," Glenn explained. "And once I accepted that just wasn't going to happen, honestly, I started to lean into it a bit more. I just let myself be me. And through that, I was able to find a new, unique shape that hadn't been taken before."

Glenn came out as pansexual in a December 2019 interview with the Dallas Voice, making her one of the most prominent LGBTQ athletes in figure skating. Rather than dampening her competitive fire, embracing her authentic self seemed to unlock another level of performance.

## Why Amber Glenn's Olympic Medal Bid is Historic

If Amber Glenn wins gold in Milan, she'd become the oldest women's Olympic figure skating champion since Madge Syers in 1908—back when figure skating was actually a Summer Olympics event. Let that sink in for a moment.

The statistics paint a clear picture of how unusual Glenn's late-career peak is:
- Average age of Olympic gold medalists in women's singles: 19.5 years
- Of 78 medals awarded in women's singles, only 8 went to skaters 25 or older
- Only 3 of those older medalists won in the last 100 years

Glenn, at 26, is defying every expectation about age and peak performance in her sport.

She's also attempting to end an American drought. The U.S. women haven't won an Olympic figure skating medal since Sasha Cohen's silver in 2006. The last American gold? Sarah Hughes in 2002. That's a 24-year gap Glenn is looking to close.

## Amber Glenn Uses Olympic Platform for LGBTQ Advocacy

Glenn hasn't shied away from controversy at these Games. At a pre-Olympic press conference, she directly criticized the current political climate facing the LGBTQ community in America.

"It's been a hard time for the community overall in this administration," Glenn said in Milan. "It isn't the first time that we've had to come together as a community and try and fight for our human rights."

When asked about keeping sports and politics separate, Glenn pushed back firmly:

"I hope I can use my platform and my voice throughout these Games to try and encourage people to stay strong in these hard times. I know that a lot of people say you're just an athlete, like, stick to your job, shut up about politics, but politics affect us all. It is something that I will not just be quiet about because it is something that affects us in our everyday lives."

For Glenn, authenticity and advocacy aren't separate from her athletic success—they're integral to it.

## What to Watch for in Amber Glenn's Olympic Performances

Glenn's competition begins with the women's short program on February 14th (Valentine's Day, poetically enough). Her key technical elements to watch include:

- **Triple axel**: The jump that elevated her to elite status
- **Triple-triple combinations**: Her consistency on these has improved dramatically
- **Artistic interpretation**: Glenn's programs have become more emotionally authentic as she's embraced her identity

Her main competition will come from Japanese and Korean skaters who dominate women's figure skating globally. But Glenn's recent scores suggest she's right in the mix for a medal.
