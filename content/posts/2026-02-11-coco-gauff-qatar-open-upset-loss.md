The tennis world is buzzing after **Coco Gauff's shocking upset loss** at the Qatar TotalEnergies Open on February 10, 2026. The 21-year-old American, ranked No. 5 in the world and a two-time Grand Slam champion, fell to Italy's Elisabetta Cocciaretto 6-4, 6-2 in just under 90 minutes. This unexpected defeat has reignited concerns about Gauff's recurring forehand problems and raised questions about her ability to translate practice form into match performance.

## What Happened in Gauff's Qatar Open Match?

Coco Gauff entered the Qatar Open as the No. 4 seed, coming off a quarterfinal appearance at the Australian Open. However, her second-round encounter with world No. 57 Cocciaretto quickly turned into a nightmare.

The numbers tell a brutal story: Gauff committed **39 unforced errors against just 13 winners**. Her forehand, long identified as a technical weakness, sprayed errors in every direction — some sailing long to the back wall, others flying wide, and a few shanked straight up into the air.

"I just feel like I haven't showed up with my best level the last few matches," Gauff admitted in her post-match press conference. "I just feel like some of the things I've been working on in practice aren't translating to the match court, which is super frustrating."

Cocciaretto, meanwhile, played with fearless aggression. The Italian took the ball early, stood inside the baseline, and punished anything short with devastating crosscourt backhands. It was her third career Top 10 victory — and her first-ever win over Gauff since their junior days back in 2018.

## The Coco Gauff Forehand Problem: A Deeper Look

The forehand issue isn't new for Gauff. Tennis analysts have pointed out technical flaws in her stroke mechanics for years, and the slow hard courts in Doha exposed these weaknesses mercilessly.

Here's what's happening: When Gauff tries to be aggressive with her forehand, she generates too many unforced errors. When she plays it safe with heavy topspin to push opponents back, skilled ball-strikers like Cocciaretto take the ball early and crush it.

"I tried to be more aggressive and was hitting more unforced errors," Gauff explained. "When I tried to be a little more passive and play with more shape, she was taking the ball early and crushing the ball."

This creates a frustrating catch-22. Her defensive forehand worked against players like Karolína Muchová at the Australian Open, but in slower conditions, it simply sits up for opponents to attack. The solution likely requires significant technical remodeling — a process that takes time away from the tour that few top players can afford.

## Mental Blocks and Practice vs. Match Performance

Perhaps more concerning than the technical issues is Gauff's candid admission about her mental state. The reigning Roland Garros champion spoke openly about a "mental block" preventing her from executing in matches what she can do freely in practice.

"Physically, I know I can do it and I can do it when there's not much pressure," Gauff said. "I need to figure out how to do it when there's more pressure."

This disconnect between practice and performance is common among elite athletes, but it's alarming to hear from someone of Gauff's caliber. She's been here before — her bright start to 2026, including a victory over Iga Swiatek at the United Cup, gave way to a 6-1, 6-2 demolition by Elina Svitolina in Melbourne. Now, just weeks later, another top-tier opponent has exposed similar vulnerabilities.

## Cocciaretto's Inspired Performance

Credit must go to Elisabetta Cocciaretto, who played with the fearlessness she admires in her sporting idols — Italian downhill skiers competing at the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics.

"I love how they approach the sport," Cocciaretto said. "They have fear of nothing. They're focused a lot and they put themselves after everything."

The 25-year-old Italian entered the tournament as a lucky loser after falling in qualifying, but she seized her opportunity brilliantly. Her game plan was simple but devastatingly effective: hold her position on the baseline, take everything early, and use her punishing crosscourt backhand to break down Gauff's defenses.

The match's turning point came at 2-2 in the first set. Cocciaretto broke Gauff's serve with a sensational 33-shot rally, running her American opponent ragged before finally finding an opening with a backhand winner. From there, she never looked back.

## What This Means for Gauff's 2026 Season

The loss itself won't significantly impact Gauff's ranking. She remains firmly in the top five and still has the resume of a future world No. 1. But the pattern emerging in her recent results is troubling.

Here's the dilemma facing Gauff and her team: Fixing a forehand isn't like fixing a serve. A serve is a "closed skill" — you control everything about it. A forehand is an "open skill" that must respond to countless variations in speed, spin, and context. Proper remodeling requires extended time away from competition, but missing tournaments means losing ranking points and prize money.

Some matches will look like this one — Gauff overwhelmed by flat-hitting aggressors who take time away from her. Others will look like her Melbourne loss to Svitolina. But many more will still result in wins, where Gauff's otherworldly backhand, exceptional speed, and competitive fire carry her through.

The question is whether that's enough for a player with Grand Slam aspirations — or whether she'll eventually need to take that difficult step back to rebuild her game for the long term.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why did Coco Gauff lose at the Qatar Open 2026?

### What is wrong with Coco Gauff's forehand?

Gauff's forehand has technical flaws that cause inconsistency under pressure. When she plays aggressively, she makes too many errors. When she plays defensively with heavy topspin, opponents can take the ball early and attack. Fixing these issues would require significant time away from tournament play for technical remodeling.

### What is Coco Gauff's current world ranking?

As of February 2026, Coco Gauff is ranked No. 5 in the WTA singles rankings. She is a two-time Grand Slam champion, having won the US Open in 2023 and Roland Garros in 2025, and remains one of the most talented young players on tour at just 21 years old.

## Looking Ahead

Gauff heads next to the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships, where she reached the semifinals in 2023. The Middle East swing has historically been challenging territory for her — early exits in Doha and Dubai are almost annual occurrences.

But if there's one thing we've learned about Coco Gauff, it's her remarkable resilience. She's bounced back from tough losses before and will likely do so again. The forehand problems aren't going away overnight, but neither is her talent, determination, or championship pedigree.

For now, tennis fans and analysts will be watching closely to see how Gauff navigates this critical stretch of her career. The road to becoming a consistent world No. 1 has never been smooth — and Gauff's journey is proving that all over again.
