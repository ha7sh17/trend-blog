Jordan Stolz is about to become a household name. The 21-year-old American speed skater has arrived at the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics as the most dominant force in his sport, and over the next 11 days, he has a legitimate shot at winning four gold medals. If he pulls it off, Stolz would accomplish something no American has done since the legendary Eric Heiden swept five golds in Lake Placid back in 1980.

No pressure, right?

## Who Is Jordan Stolz and Why Is He Trending?

Jordan Stolz is a speed skating prodigy from Kewaskum, Wisconsin—a small town about 45 miles north of Milwaukee. He's a seven-time world champion, the current world record holder in the 1,000 meters (1:05.37), and the youngest male World Allround champion in 46 years.

His first Olympic event kicks off today—Wednesday, February 11—with the men's 1,000 meters. And this is just the beginning. Stolz is expected to contend for gold in the 500m, 1,000m, 1,500m, and the mass start event. That's four potential gold medals at a single Winter Games.

To put that in perspective: only three athletes have ever won four gold medals at the same Winter Olympics. If Stolz pulls off even three, he joins Heiden as the only American—man or woman, in any sport—to achieve that feat at a Winter Games.

## The Eric Heiden Comparisons Are Inevitable

You can't write about Jordan Stolz without mentioning Eric Heiden. The comparisons have followed Stolz for years, and they're not just media hype. The similarities between these two athletes are almost eerie.

Both grew up in small Wisconsin towns. Both learned to skate on frozen ponds as kids. Both made their Olympic debuts at 17 but were too young to medal. Both came back four years later as the dominant force in speed skating.

"It's a little freaky how similar our histories are," Heiden recently told Yahoo Sports. "Every time I think about it, I'm like dang, man, this guy is the same as I was."

And when asked if Stolz is the best American speedskater since himself? Heiden didn't hesitate.

"He's a once-in-a-generation athlete. There hasn't been anybody better for decades."

## From a Frozen Pond to the World Stage

The Jordan Stolz origin story starts on a three-acre pond behind his family's home. His father Dirk, a German immigrant and former youth ski racer, and mother Jane wanted to raise their kids outdoors. They bought land outside Milwaukee and built a house overlooking forest and prairie.

The 2010 Vancouver Olympics changed everything. Dirk declared to the family that the TV would stay on for two weeks—unusual for a household that limited screen time. Five-year-old Jordan and his sister Hannah watched, mesmerized, as short-track star Apolo Anton Ohno won medals.

Days later, the kids were on the backyard pond in cheap hockey skates and life vests (Jane was terrified of the ice cracking). That simple beginning sparked an obsession.

Dirk eventually plowed an oval into the pond and set up lights so Jordan could practice after dark. One night, Jane shined a flashlight into the backyard to find her son doing laps alone, working on his crossover technique.

"You still out there?" she shouted.

"Just a little bit longer," Jordan replied.

That drive never left him.

## Jordan Stolz's Path to Olympic Dominance

The pond got too small. The family started making the 40-minute drive to the Pettit National Ice Center—the first indoor speed skating oval in the U.S. and training ground for legends like Bonnie Blair, Dan Jansen, and Shani Davis.

At around age 10, legendary coach Bob Fenn—known for developing Shani Davis into a two-time Olympic gold medalist—volunteered to train Jordan and his sister. "I've got another Eric and Beth Heiden," Fenn told their parents. (Beth Heiden, Eric's sister, was also an Olympic medalist.)

Under Fenn's guidance, Stolz's career accelerated rapidly:

- **2022 Beijing Olympics:** Made his Olympic debut at 17, finishing 13th in the 500m and 14th in the 1,000m
- **2023 World Championships:** Swept the 500m, 1,000m, and 1,500m
- **2024 World Championships:** Repeated the treble, cementing his dominance
- **January 2024:** Set the world record in the 1,000m with a time of 1:05.37
- **2025-26 World Cup:** Won 16 out of 24 races entered; riding a 14-race unbeaten streak in the 1,000m

Now, at 21, he's the overwhelming favorite to dominate these Olympics.

## Jordan Stolz's 2026 Olympics Schedule

Here's when to watch Stolz compete at the Milano Speed Skating Stadium (all times Eastern):

| Date | Event | Time (ET) |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Wed, Feb 11 | Men's 1,000m | 12:30 PM |
| Sat, Feb 14 | Men's 500m | 11:00 AM |
| Thu, Feb 19 | Men's 1,500m | 10:30 AM |
| Sat, Feb 21 | Men's Mass Start | 3:00 PM / 4:40 PM |

The 1,000m today is his best event—he holds the world record and hasn't lost a World Cup race in it for 14 straight competitions. But he'll face tough competition from Dutch skaters Jenning De Boo and Joep Wennemars. The Netherlands has won the last three Olympic golds in this event.

## The Mental Game: How Stolz Handles Pressure

What sets elite athletes apart isn't just physical ability—it's how they handle the weight of expectations. Stolz seems almost unnaturally calm about it.

"I try to deal with it as if it's just another race, so everything else around you is just extra noise," he said. "There's more pressure on this one because you've been training for it for four years, but at the end of the day, it's going to the line and competing like usual."

That mindset was shaped partly by working with Shani Davis, who instilled a philosophy of constant improvement. Nothing was ever a 10 out of 10—maybe a six or seven. There's always room to get better. You can hear it in how Stolz talks even now. Good, but never perfect.

It's that relentless drive for marginal gains that explains why Stolz once spent six hours at a blade factory checking manufacturing inconsistencies. In a sport where hundredths of a second matter, he leaves nothing to chance.

## Could Jordan Stolz Become the Face of the Winter Olympics?

NBC is betting on it. The network has positioned Stolz prominently in its Olympic coverage and marketing, including a teaser ad with Hollywood actor Glen Powell. (Stolz admits with a trace of frustration that filming cost him a precious day of training.)

In the Netherlands, where speed skating is as culturally significant as the NFL is in America, Stolz is already a star. He gets recognized walking through city streets. Back home in Wisconsin? He can still go to the grocery store unnoticed.

That anonymity is about to end.

If Stolz delivers on his potential over the next 11 days, he won't just be collecting medals—he'll be writing himself into Olympic history. The kid who learned to skate in a life vest on a frozen Wisconsin pond could become the defining figure of these entire Winter Games.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many gold medals could Jordan Stolz win at the 2026 Olympics?

Jordan Stolz is competing in four events at the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics: the 500m, 1,000m, 1,500m, and mass start. He's the favorite in the 1,000m and 1,500m, a strong contender in the 500m, and has medal potential in the mass start. If he wins all four, he'd match the Winter Olympic record for gold medals at a single Games.

### Has Jordan Stolz won Olympic medals before?

No, the 2026 Milano Cortina Games are Jordan Stolz's first real chance at Olympic medals. He made his Olympic debut at the 2022 Beijing Games at age 17, finishing 13th in the 500m and 14th in the 1,000m. Since then, he's become the dominant force in world speed skating, winning seven world championship titles.

### Why is Jordan Stolz compared to Eric Heiden?

Both skaters grew up in small Wisconsin towns, learned to skate on frozen ponds, debuted at the Olympics at age 17, and returned four years later as the world's best. Eric Heiden himself has called Stolz "a once-in-a-generation athlete" and the best American speedskater since himself. If Stolz wins three or more golds in Milano, he'll join Heiden as the only American to accomplish that feat at a Winter Olympics.

## The Bottom Line

Jordan Stolz's quest for Olympic glory begins today. Whether he wins one gold medal or four, we're witnessing the arrival of a generational talent. The kid from the frozen pond in Wisconsin is about to find out if he can deliver on a decade of promise under the brightest spotlight in sports.

Set your alarms. This is appointment television.
